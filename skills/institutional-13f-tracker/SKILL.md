# Institutional 13F Tracker (SentiSense)

See who owns a stock and how the big money is repositioning. This skill reads institutional ownership from SEC 13F filings through the read-only SentiSense API: the top institutional holders for any ticker, aggregate buying and selling per stock, activist positions, and a full portfolio for any manager (from Berkshire Hathaway to the largest index funds), with quarter-over-quarter change types (new, increased, decreased, sold out) across thousands of filers.

Read-only educational data interface. Output is informational context, never a personalized buy or sell recommendation.

## When to Use

Reach for this skill when the question is about institutional ownership or 13F positioning:

- "Who owns $NVDA?" or "top institutional holders of $TSLA"
- "What did Berkshire Hathaway buy and sell last quarter?" (a manager's whole portfolio)
- "What did this manager buy and sell, in dollars?" (estimated dollar flows per position and in total)
- "How has this manager's book changed over the last few years?" (filing-by-filing history)
- "Is institutional money accumulating or distributing $AAPL?" (aggregate flows)
- "Which activist funds took new positions this quarter?"
- "How did 13F ownership of $COIN change quarter over quarter?"

This skill pairs naturally with `politicians-stock-tracker` and `insider-trading-tracker`: line up 13F accumulation against a congressional purchase or an insider cluster buy on the same ticker. Convergence across sources is the high-conviction read.

Do not use it for order entry, portfolio management, or personalized advice. It has no write, trading, or wallet surface; every endpoint is a GET.

## What this data actually is (read before interpreting)

- **13F is quarterly and lagged.** Institutions file 13F-HR within 45 days after each quarter end. A quarter stays `pending: true` through the effective SEC filing deadline day in New York (that 45th day, rolled past weekends and federal holidays) and turns settled (`ownershipEligible: true`) the next calendar day. So the newest settled quarter is the quarter that just ended only once its deadline has passed; for about six weeks after each quarter end it is the one before. Never present any of it as real-time positioning.
- **Always resolve the quarter first.** The quarter-scoped feeds (`/flows`, `/activist`, `/bonds`, `/options`) need a `reportDate`. Four endpoints do not: `/quarters` is the resolver itself, `/holders/{ticker}` serves the latest settled quarter for the ticker when you omit it, echoes the one it used, and reports any newer still-filing quarter separately in `earlyFilers` rather than mixing it into the roster, `/institutions` takes an optional `quarter` (the `value` form, `2026Q2`, not a `reportDate`), and `/institution/{slugOrCik}` takes neither and answers on its own latest quarter. Through the effective filing deadline day, the newest entry is `pending: true` and holds only early filers; use the first quarter with `pending: false` for complete data. **Filter on the flag, never on position.** Once the filing window closes, the pending entry is gone and the newest quarter in the array is already complete, so code that skips index 0 on the assumption that the first row is always pending will quote a quarter that is three months staler than what you were served. Checked live on 2026-08-31: the array led with Q2 2026 at `pending: false` and contained no pending entry at all.
- **Dollar flows are estimates, not trades.** `estimatedFlowUsd`, `boughtUsd`, `trimmedUsd`, `exitedUsd` and `netFlowUsd` are worked out from two quarter-end snapshots (this filing against the one before it), so they are not reported trades and say nothing about when in the quarter anything happened. A 13F also covers long US-listed equity only: short positions, futures and non-US holdings are not in these numbers. Say both whenever you quote a dollar flow.
- **Filer categories:** `INDEX_FUND`, `HEDGE_FUND`, `ACTIVIST`, `PENSION`, `BANK`, `INSURANCE`, `MUTUAL_FUND`, `SOVEREIGN_WEALTH`, `ENDOWMENT`, `CONGLOMERATE`, `OTHER`.
- **Parent/subsidiary rollups.** Large managers file under many CIKs (e.g. Vanguard). A filer profile carries `multiCikRollup` / `childCikCount` / `childCiks` so sub-manager holdings roll up into one portfolio. Report the rollup, not double-counted child rows.
- **Report values as given.** The dollar field is **`valueUsd`** on both sides of the join: on a holder row under `/holders/{ticker}` and on a holding row inside a manager's portfolio. There is no bare `value` field on either. It arrives already denominated in US dollars, so quote it as the reported 13F value and do not re-scale or invent a unit. (`/bonds` names its own total `totalValue` and `/institutional/options` splits into `callValue` / `putValue`; those are the only other dollar keys in this family.)

## Prerequisites

- A free `SENTISENSE_API_KEY`. Get one at https://app.sentisense.ai/get-api-key. Required on every call; anonymous requests return `401 api_key_required`. No key yet? Follow "No key yet" in the `0-sentisense-onboarding` skill: one POST returns a temporary free key the agent can use right away and a link the user opens to keep it.
- Any HTTP client. Plain `curl` works, or Python 3.8+ using only the standard library. On macOS python.org installs can raise `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`: run `Install Certificates.command`, use the system `/usr/bin/python3`, or use `curl`.
- Network access to `https://app.sentisense.ai`.
- Read-only scope. Every endpoint here is a GET.

| Tier | Quota | Rate | 13F data |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| Free | 1,000 requests/month | 30 requests/min | preview slice (top N per endpoint) |
| PRO ($15/mo) | Unlimited | 300 requests/min | full holder lists and full portfolios |

## Permissions

- Network: HTTPS to app.sentisense.ai only.
- Credentials: SENTISENSE_API_KEY from the environment.
- Shell: none required.
- Files: none.

## How to Run

Issue HTTP GET requests to `https://app.sentisense.ai`, authenticated with the `X-SentiSense-API-Key` header. Keep the key in the shell environment; never place it in a query string or in user-facing output.

**Step 1, always: resolve the quarter.** `/quarters` is a bare array (no envelope). Every other institutional endpoint returns the wrapped envelope `{ isPreview, previewReason, data }`, so unwrap `.data` first. Unwrapping is not the same as iterating: on `/holders/{ticker}`, `/institution/{slugOrCik}`, `/institutions` and `/flows` the unwrapped `data` is an **object**, and the rows sit one level further in (`data.holders`, `data.holdings`, `data.institutions`, and `data.inflows` / `data.outflows` respectively). Check for a list before you loop. A `429` returns a `Retry-After` header; back off rather than serving a stale value.

**Identify your client.** Send a `User-Agent` naming your agent runtime and this skill, for
example `OpenClaw/1.4 (institutional-13f-tracker)` or `ClaudeCode/2.1 (institutional-13f-tracker)`. Substitute your own runtime and
version if neither matches. You can also volunteer what your agent is called by adding an
`agent/<your-agent-name>` token inside the same parentheses, as in
`OpenClaw/1.4 (institutional-13f-tracker; agent/research-desk)`. All of it is optional, and it is what tells
us this skill has real integrations behind it, so it gets prioritized and you get notice before it
changes.

```bash
# 1) get valid reporting quarters, pick the first with pending=false
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/institutional/quarters"
# -> [{ "value": "2026Q3", "label": "Q3 2026", "reportDate": "2026-09-30",
#       "pending": true, "ownershipEligible": false, "ownershipEligibleAt": "2026-11-17" }, ...]
```

## Endpoints

- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/quarters`** : available 13F reporting quarters. **Public**, bare array of `{ value, label, reportDate, pending, ownershipEligible, ownershipEligibleAt }`, newest first. `pending` is true through the effective SEC filing deadline day; `ownershipEligible` turns true the next New York calendar day, which `ownershipEligibleAt` gives as an ISO date (it does not certify that every institution filed). Call this first; use the first `pending: false` `reportDate` everywhere below.
- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/holders/{ticker}`** : institutional holders for a stock. `reportDate` is **optional here**: omit it and the endpoint serves the latest quarter that has holders for this ticker, preferring a settled quarter over a still-filing one, and tells you which one it used in `data.reportDate` (`data.selection.status` says whether it is settled). Pass `?reportDate=` from `/quarters` when you want a specific quarter or are comparing several tickers on one date. The holder list is nested at **`data.holders`** (not `data` directly). Each holder carries `filerName`, `filerCik`, `filerCategory`, `entitySlug`, `cikCount`, `shares`, `sharesChange`, `sharesChangePct`, **`valueUsd`** (the dollar field, there is no bare `value`), `changeType` (`NEW` / `INCREASED` / `DECREASED` / `SOLD_OUT` / `UNCHANGED`), and its own `comparisonStatus`. `data` always carries `holderCount` (full-quarter count). It also carries:
  - `data.selection`: `mode` (`DEFAULT` when you omitted `reportDate`, `EXPLICIT` when you passed one), `status` (`settled` or `filing`), `policyVersion`, `marketDefaultReportDate` (the newest eligible quarter market-wide) and `isStaleForMarket` (true when this ticker is served from an older quarter than that).
  - `data.earlyFilersStatus`: `AVAILABLE`, `NONE` (no newer filing quarter observed) or `UNAVAILABLE` (that supplementary read failed; the roster is still served). When `AVAILABLE`, `data.earlyFilers` describes the newer still-filing quarter: `reportDate`, `status` (`filing`), `holderCount`, `distinctFilerCount`, `baselineFilerCount` and an optional `coveragePct` (the share of this ticker's settled-quarter institutional value held by filers already confirmed for the newer quarter). Report it as an early read beside the settled roster, never blended into it.
  - `data.notableHolders` with `data.notableHoldersScope` (`full_roster`): well-known institutions holding the stock, matched against the quarter's full roster rather than the page you fetched. Free returns up to five names and identifiers only; PRO adds position and change fields. It does not expand the free `holders` preview.
  - `data.comparisonReportDate` and `data.comparisonStatus`: the prior quarter used for share changes and a conservative summary (`AVAILABLE`, `PRIOR_QUARTER_UNAVAILABLE`, `INCOMPLETE_INPUT`, `INCOMPLETE_FAMILY_COVERAGE` or `UNAVAILABLE`). The summary can read incomplete while individual rows are complete, so judge each holder by its own `comparisonStatus`: only `AVAILABLE` supports a quarter-change claim for that holder. **Paging (recommended):** pass `limit` (1-1000), `offset`, `sortBy`, `sortDir`. A mega-cap can have 5,000+ holders, and `notableChanges` (holders with a 10%+ change on 10k+ shares) plus `returnedCount` are returned **only when `limit` is passed**. Free: top 5, and free previews omit `returnedCount`, `offset`, and `notableChanges` even when `limit` is passed (`holderCount` stays the full-quarter count).
- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/flows?reportDate=`** : aggregate institutional buying/selling per ticker. **`data` is an object, not a list**, so iterating `.data` gets you nothing: the two ranked ticker arrays are at **`data.inflows`** and **`data.outflows`**, alongside `data.reportDate`, `data.filerCount`, `data.baselineFilerCount` and `data.isPending`. Each row carries `ticker`, `companyName`, `dollarFlowUsd`, `netSharesChange`, `totalSharesBought` / `totalSharesSold`, the position counts (`newPositions`, `increasedPositions`, `decreasedPositions`, `soldOutPositions`), `avgClosePrice`, and a per-category net-change breakdown (`hedgeFundNetChange`, `indexFundNetChange`, `activistNetChange`, and one per remaining filer category). Free: top 5.
- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/activist?reportDate=`** : activist-filer positions for the quarter (NEW or INCREASED stakes). Free: top 3; PRO: full.
- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/bonds?reportDate=`** : convertible bond flows grouped by base ticker, the credit-side leg of the same 13F filings. Free: top 3; PRO: full.
- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/options?reportDate=`** : institutional options positions with the call/put breakdown, as disclosed on 13F. Quarterly and end-of-quarter, not live flow. Free: top 3; PRO: full.
- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/institutions`** : the filterable universe of tracked filers (use it to find a manager's slug/CIK for the endpoint below). Query `category`, `minAumUsd`, `sort`, `quarter`. Full list on every tier, and quota-exempt.
- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/institution/{slugOrCik}`** : a single manager's profile, summary stats, and current-quarter equity holdings. Resolve by URL slug (`Berkshire-Hathaway`) or CIK of 1 to 10 digits (`1067983`, leading zeros optional). Free: profile + top 10 holdings; PRO: full holdings. Holdings include `ticker, companyName, shares, valueUsd, changeType, sharesChange, sharesChangePct, portfolioWeight`, plus `multiCikRollup` / `childCiks` for parent/subsidiary rollups. Returns 404 for an unknown slug or CIK. Paged mode (PRO) starts when you pass `limit` (1-1000) and adds `offset`, `sortBy`, `sortDir` and three filters: `changeType` (a comma list of `NEW`, `INCREASED`, `DECREASED`, `SOLD_OUT`, `UNCHANGED`, or `HELD` for every position still held), `q` (ticker or company name) and `minWeight` (percent). `sortBy` takes `valueUsd` (default), `shares`, `portfolioWeight`, `sharesChangePct`, `valueChangeUsd`, `sharesChange`, `estimatedFlowUsd` or `priorValueUsd`. Filters apply before sorting and paging, the envelope's `totalCount` counts the matches, and `data.matchTotals` sums the whole matching set (`count`, `valueUsd`, and `priorValueUsd` and `estimatedFlowUsd` when the comparison is available). Without `limit` the filters are ignored and you get the full list. `data.matchTotals` appears only when `changeType`, `q` or `minWeight` is passed, not on a sort-only page. On Free, `limit` and every filter are ignored: you get the top 10 holdings by value and no `matchTotals`, so check each row's `changeType` instead of assuming the filter applied. The count of positions held is `data.positionsHeld`; `holdingsCount` and an unfiltered `totalCount` include `SOLD_OUT` rows. Large filers return big payloads (`optionPositions` can be about 1 MB), so select only the fields you need. When `data.comparisonStatus` is `AVAILABLE` the response adds `data.priorTotalValueUsd` and `data.priorPositionsHeld`, and each holding adds `priorValueUsd`, `priorPortfolioWeight` and `estimatedFlowUsd` (positive bought, negative sold, priced at the filing's quarter-end price, so for a fast mover it can exceed the prior position's value; the value change `valueUsd - priorValueUsd` mixes price moves with trading, which is why the flow field exists).
- **`GET /api/v1/institutional/institution/{slugOrCik}/history`** : a manager's book filing by filing, newest first. Query `quarters` (1-40, default 12) and optional `tickers` (comma list, up to 100) which adds `data.positions`: per ticker, a newest-first list of `{reportDate, shares, valueUsd}` (a filing where the manager did not hold the ticker is absent from the list). Free keys get `positions` only for the manager's ten largest holdings (the tickers in the free preview of the detail endpoint); a ticker missing from a Free response may only be outside the top ten, so never say the manager does not hold it. Each row of `data.quarters` carries `reportDate`, `value`, `label`, `status` (`settled` or `filing`), `comparisonStatus`, `comparisonReportDate`, `totalValueUsd`, `positionsHeld` and `top10Pct`, and, only when its `comparisonStatus` is `AVAILABLE`, the position counts plus `boughtUsd`, `trimmedUsd`, `exitedUsd`, `netFlowUsd` (`boughtUsd - trimmedUsd - exitedUsd`) and `priceEffectUsd` (the change in `totalValueUsd` since the previous filing minus `netFlowUsd`: the remainder after trading, mostly price moves, which also absorbs rounding, the different price bases of exits and trades, and positions whose change could not be restated). API key required; PRO returns the requested window, Free the newest four filings as a preview (`isPreview: true`, `totalCount` is the size of the requested window). The first call for a large multi-filer manager can take up to about a minute, so use a 60 second client timeout (repeat calls are fast), and a `503` with `{"error": "history_busy"}` plus a `Retry-After` header means retry after that many seconds. Bad `quarters` or `tickers` return `400`; unknown manager returns 404.

## Workflows

**1. Who owns this stock?**

```bash
Q=2026-06-30  # first pending:false reportDate from /quarters
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/institutional/holders/NVDA?reportDate=$Q&limit=25"
```
Or drop `reportDate` and let the endpoint pick the ticker's latest settled quarter; `data.reportDate` and `data.selection` say which one you got. Read `data.holders` and lead with the largest holders and their `NEW` / `INCREASED` / `SOLD_OUT` change types, quoting a change only where that holder's `comparisonStatus` is `AVAILABLE`; mention `data.earlyFilers` as a separate early read of the next quarter when present; on PRO, `limit` also returns `notableChanges` (a `count` of holders that changed 10% or more on 10k+ shares, plus the `top` five of them by dollar value), while a free preview omits it, so on free read the changes off the five holders shown and never report "no notable changes".

**2. A manager's whole portfolio (what did they buy and sell?)**

```bash
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/institutional/institution/Berkshire-Hathaway"
```
Summarize new positions, adds, trims, and exits by `changeType`, and the biggest holdings by `portfolioWeight`. `portfolioWeight` is rounded to 0.1%: compute a share of the book as `valueUsd / totalValueUsd`. The count of positions held is `data.positionsHeld`, because `holdingsCount` includes `SOLD_OUT` rows.

**2b. What did this manager buy and sell, in dollars?** PRO, paged mode. Rank by the estimated dollars, not by the position's size:

```bash
B="https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/institutional/institution/Berkshire-Hathaway"
H="X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY"
# newly opened positions, largest first
curl -s -H "$H" "$B?limit=20&changeType=NEW&sortBy=valueUsd&sortDir=desc"
# biggest adds, then biggest sells (negative flows come first when ascending)
curl -s -H "$H" "$B?limit=20&changeType=NEW,INCREASED&sortBy=estimatedFlowUsd&sortDir=desc"
curl -s -H "$H" "$B?limit=20&changeType=DECREASED,SOLD_OUT&sortBy=estimatedFlowUsd&sortDir=asc"
# whole-quarter exits and their total
curl -s -H "$H" "$B?limit=20&changeType=SOLD_OUT"
```
Read `data.holdings[].estimatedFlowUsd` for each name and `data.matchTotals.estimatedFlowUsd` for the total over everything the filter matched, not just the page (`matchTotals` exists only when `changeType`, `q` or `minWeight` is passed, so a sort-only call has no total). On Free the filters are ignored and `matchTotals` is absent, so check each row's `changeType` yourself. Quote a flow only when `data.comparisonStatus` is `AVAILABLE`, and call it an estimate from two quarter-end snapshots priced at the filing's quarter-end price; it can exceed the prior position's value for a fast mover, and it is not cash. Do not use `valueUsd - priorValueUsd` as "dollars bought": it includes price moves.

**2c. How has this manager's book changed over time?**

```bash
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/institutional/institution/Berkshire-Hathaway/history?quarters=8&tickers=AAPL"
```
Read `data.quarters` newest first for the size of the book (`totalValueUsd`), how many names it holds (`positionsHeld`) and how concentrated it is (`top10Pct`). To explain a change in value, read the bridge: `netFlowUsd` is the estimated trading (`boughtUsd` less `trimmedUsd` and `exitedUsd`) and `priceEffectUsd` is the remainder, mostly price moves. Report it as "estimated trading explains X of the change; the rest, mostly price moves, is Y", and do not conclude that the holdings rose or fell in price from it alone. Rows whose `comparisonStatus` is not `AVAILABLE` have no flow fields; skip them rather than filling in zeros. Sanity-check the sequence before narrating it: if `totalValueUsd` or `positionsHeld` swings by more than about 50% and snaps back in the next filing, treat that filing as possibly incomplete, say so, and do not describe its flows as trading (Berkshire's 2025Q1 filing is a live example: a huge net sale followed by an equal net purchase). `data.positions` follows named tickers across filings (shares and value per filing); on Free it covers only the manager's ten largest holdings. On Free only the newest four filings arrive, so say that a longer view needs PRO.

**3. Aggregate accumulation vs distribution**

```bash
Q=2026-06-30  # first pending:false reportDate from /quarters
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/institutional/flows?reportDate=$Q"
```

Read the accumulation side from `data.inflows` and the distribution side from `data.outflows`, each already ranked by the size of `dollarFlowUsd` (negative on the outflow side). A ticker appears on the side its net quarter landed on, never on both, so read the two lists as one board rather than netting them against each other.

**4. Activist watch**

```bash
Q=2026-06-30  # first pending:false reportDate from /quarters
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/institutional/activist?reportDate=$Q"
```

**5. Follow the convergence.** When institutional accumulation lines up with a congressional purchase (`politicians-stock-tracker`) or insider buying (`insider-trading-tracker`) on the same ticker, that agreement is the read worth surfacing. Cite each source.

## Answering well

- Always state the `reportDate` you are quoting and that 13F data is a quarterly snapshot filed up to 45 days after quarter end.
- Keep the settled quarter and early filers apart: quote the roster from the settled quarter, and present `earlyFilers` (with its `coveragePct` when present) as partial coverage of the next quarter, not as the new ownership picture.
- Attribute holdings to the filer and category; roll parent/subsidiary CIKs into one manager rather than double-counting.
- Use `changeType` and `sharesChangePct` to describe direction; quote `valueUsd` as the reported 13F value without re-scaling.
- When you quote a dollar flow, say it is an estimate from two quarter-end snapshots and that a 13F covers long US equity only; never describe `netFlowUsd` or `estimatedFlowUsd` as reported trades or cash flow.
- Report only what the API returns. Do not infer positions, prices, or intent that are not in the data, and do not frame any of it as advice.
