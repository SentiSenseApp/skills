## Authentication

```bash
# Include API key in header
curl -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: ss_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/..."
```

```python
from sentisense import SentiSenseClient
client = SentiSenseClient(api_key="ss_live_YOUR_KEY")
```

All API endpoints require an API key. Get one free at https://app.sentisense.ai/get-api-key (manage it anytime in the [Developer Console](https://app.sentisense.ai/settings/developer)).

### Access Tiers

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Public** | Available on all tiers (Free and PRO) |
| **Public (preview)** | Free gets limited preview; PRO gets full data |
| **Quota-gated** | Consumes monthly quota (Free: limited, PRO: unlimited) |
| **Discovery (no quota cost)** | API key required (identity/abuse tracking), but the call does not burn your monthly quota. Rate-limit-per-minute still applies. Used for lightweight metadata endpoints like `/stocks/with-kpis` and `/stocks/{ticker}/kpis/types`. |
| **PRO only** | Requires PRO subscription |

### Rate Limits

| Tier | Requests/Month | Rate |
|------|----------------|------|
| Free | 1,000 | 30 requests/minute |
| PRO ($15/mo) | Unlimited | 300 requests/minute |

### Ticker Symbols

Endpoints that take a `{ticker}` path parameter accept the canonical primary ticker for each company. For dual-class share companies, the API also accepts the secondary class as an alias and resolves it server-side, so you can pass whichever ticker your data source provides.

| You pass | Resolves to | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `GOOG` | `GOOGL` | Alphabet Class C resolves to Class A |
| `BRK.A`, `BRK-A`, `BRKA` | `BRK.B` | Berkshire Class A resolves to Class B |
| `BRK-B`, `BRKB` | `BRK.B` | Punctuation variants normalized |

Aliasing applies to research endpoints (analyst, KPIs, insights, insider, institutional holders, politicians filings). Quote and chart endpoints leave the ticker as-is, since market-data providers handle their own symbology. Tickers are case-insensitive. News Corp (`NWSA`/`NWS`) and Fox (`FOXA`/`FOX`) are NOT aliased to each other (each class is tracked separately).

## What You Can Build

### Smart Money Tracker
Cross-reference insider trading, institutional flows, and politician trades to follow where the smart money is moving. High-conviction signals come from convergence across all three.
- `GET /api/v1/insider/activity` for market-wide insider buying/selling
- `GET /api/v1/institutional/flows?reportDate={date}` for quarterly institutional positioning
- `GET /api/v1/politicians/activity` for congressional STOCK Act trades
- `GET /api/v1/insights/stock/{ticker}` for AI signals that combine these data sources

### Sentiment-Driven Watchlist
Alert when sentiment shifts for your stocks. Track news volume, social mentions, and baseline deviations.
- `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{ticker}/metric/sentiment` for sentiment time series
- `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{ticker}/baselines/sentiment` for anomaly detection (3-sigma deviations)
- `GET /api/v1/documents/ticker/{ticker}` for the underlying news and social posts driving the shift

### Congressional Trade Monitor
Track what Congress is buying before it moves. Filter by party, chamber, or individual politician. Check if corporate insiders agree.
- `GET /api/v1/politicians/activity` for recent congressional trades across all members
- `GET /api/v1/politicians/member/{slug}` for individual politician profiles and trade history
- `GET /api/v1/insider/trades/{ticker}` to cross-reference with corporate insider activity on the same stock

### AI Research Assistant
Generate stock research reports by combining multiple data signals into a single analysis.
- `GET /api/v1/stocks/{ticker}/ai-summary?depth=deep` for the full AI analysis report
- `GET /api/v1/insights/stock/{ticker}` for AI-generated stock signals
- `GET /api/v1/stocks/fundamentals?ticker={ticker}` for financial statement data
- `GET /api/v1/documents/ticker/{ticker}` for recent news context

### Earnings Calendar Monitor
Position ahead of earnings instead of reacting to them. Pull the forward calendar, intersect it with a watchlist, and pre-load sentiment and smart-money context for the companies reporting soon.
- `GET /api/v1/calendar/earnings?week=next` for who reports next week (or `?from=&to=` for a custom window)
- `GET /api/v1/calendar/earnings?ticker={ticker}` for a single name's next report date and consensus EPS
- `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{ticker}/metric/sentiment` to gauge positioning into the print
- `GET /api/v1/insider/trades/{ticker}` to see if insiders moved ahead of the date

### Market Dashboard
Real-time market overview combining prices, sentiment, and top signals.
- `GET /api/v1/stocks/market-status` to check if the market is open
- `GET /api/v1/market-summary` for AI-generated market headline and analysis
- `GET /api/v1/insights/market` for the top market-moving signals right now
- `GET /api/v1/stocks/prices?tickers=SPY,QQQ,IWM,DIA` for index tracking

## Agent Tips

### Workflow Pattern
1. Call `GET /api/v1/stocks/market-status` first to check if the market is open
2. Call `GET /api/v1/institutional/quarters` before any institutional endpoint to get valid `reportDate` values
3. All PRO-gated endpoints return `{isPreview, previewReason, data}`. Always access `response["data"]` (or `response.data`). On a preview (FREE) list response a `totalCount` field is also present: the number of items in the full PRO dataset, so you can show "showing N of totalCount"
4. Use `lookbackDays` (1-365) on insider and politician endpoints to control the time window

### Common Mistakes
- **Do NOT hardcode `reportDate`** for institutional endpoints. Always fetch from `/quarters` first; quarters change as new SEC filings come in
- **Do NOT iterate the response directly.** Unwrap `response["data"]` first. All PRO-gated endpoints use the `{isPreview, previewReason, data}` wrapper
- **Do NOT use `/api/v1/entity-metrics/*`** for metrics. These are RETIRED (return 410 Gone). Use `/api/v2/metrics/` instead
- **The `source` parameter is case-insensitive.** `news`, `NEWS`, `News` all work

### Endpoints That Do NOT Exist
Do not hallucinate these. They are not part of the SentiSense API:
- `/api/v1/options/flow` or `/api/v1/dark-pool`: we do not have options flow or dark pool data
- `/api/v1/earnings`: for the earnings calendar use `/api/v1/calendar/earnings`; for reported financials use `/api/v1/stocks/fundamentals`
- `/api/v1/alerts` or `/api/v1/notifications`: alerts are user-facing only, not available via API
- `/api/v1/chat` or `/api/v1/ask`: the AI chat is not accessible via API
- `/api/v2/sentiment`: the correct path is `/api/v2/metrics/entity/{id}/metric/sentiment`
- `/api/v1/congress` or `/api/v1/congressional`: the correct path is `/api/v1/politicians`

## Stocks API (`/api/v1/stocks`)

### GET /api/v1/stocks/price
Real-time stock price. **Public.**

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

```

Response: `{ ticker, currentPrice, change, changePercent, previousClose, volume, timestamp, expiresEpochSecond, extendedHours? }`.

`currentPrice` is always the regular-session price: live last trade during RTH (09:30 to 16:00 ET), most recent regular-session close otherwise. The optional `extendedHours` field is present only during pre-market (04:00 to 09:30 ET) or after-hours (16:00 to 20:00 ET) and carries `{ session: "pre" | "post", price, change, changePercent }`, where `change` / `changePercent` are computed vs `currentPrice`.

### GET /api/v1/stocks/prices
Batch real-time prices. **Public.** Returns a JSON array; each element has the same shape as `/price` (including a `ticker` field and an optional `extendedHours` object).

Response: `{ ticker, currentPrice, change, changePercent, volume, open, dayHigh, dayLow, previousClose, week52High, week52Low, marketCap, peRatio, epsTTM, dividendYield, movingAverage200Day, timestamp, extendedHours? }` -- all fields except `ticker` are nullable. `currentPrice` is always the regular-session price; the optional `extendedHours` object (`{ session, price, change, changePercent }`) is present only during pre-market or after-hours. `movingAverage200Day` is `null` when fewer than 200 trading days of history exist. Cached 15 s server-side.

ETF tickers (e.g. `VTI`, `SPY`) return `400 ticker_is_etf` from this endpoint. Use `GET /api/v1/etfs/{ticker}/quote` instead, which returns AUM, expense ratio, NAV, and inception date rather than market cap, P/E, and EPS.

### GET /api/v1/stocks/{ticker}/kpis
Company-specific KPI time-series. Curated GAAP and non-GAAP metrics from earnings filings: iPhone unit sales, Tesla deliveries, AWS revenue, Netflix paid net adds, etc. **PRO (preview)** -- Free: metadata only with empty `kpis` list, PRO: full series. Returns 404 for tickers without curated coverage.

Coverage today: near-complete for the S&P 500 plus extended universe (~500 tickers). Use `GET /api/v1/stocks/with-kpis` to enumerate.

Response wrapper: `{ isPreview, previewReason, data: CompanyKpis }`.

`CompanyKpis` shape: `{ ticker, companyName, cik, lastUpdated, kpis: KpiSeries[] }`.

`KpiSeries` shape: `{ id, name, category, unit, displayFormat, chartType, values: KpiDataPoint[], sourceRef, discontinued, discontinuedNote }`. `id` is a stable per-ticker identifier (e.g. `iphone_revenue`). `category` is one of `product_revenue`, `segment_revenue`, `unit_economics`, etc. `chartType` is `bar` or `line`.

`KpiDataPoint` shape: `{ period, date, value, isEstimate }`. `period` is the fiscal label (e.g. `Q2 FY2026`); `date` is the ISO close date.

### GET /api/v1/stocks/with-kpis
List every ticker with curated KPI coverage. Sorted alphabetically. Builder discovery: render a supported-tickers page or seed a watchlist without 404-probing one ticker at a time. **Discovery (no quota cost)** -- API key required for identity/abuse tracking, but the call does not consume your monthly quota. Rate-limit-per-minute still applies.

Response: `{ count, tickers: KpiCoverageEntry[] }` where each entry is `{ ticker, companyName, lastUpdated, kpiCount }`.

```python
client = SentiSenseClient(api_key="ss_live_YOUR_KEY")
coverage = client.list_kpi_coverage()
print(f"{coverage.count} tickers covered")
for entry in coverage.tickers[:5]:
    print(f"  {entry.ticker}: {entry.kpiCount} KPIs (refreshed {entry.lastUpdated})")
```

### GET /api/v1/stocks/{ticker}/kpis/types
Lightweight KPI metadata tuples for a ticker, without the full series payload. Mirrors `/api/v1/insights/stock/{ticker}/types`. Useful for letting an agent or UI decide what to fetch before committing to the heavy data call. **Discovery (no quota cost)** -- API key required, no quota burn.

Response: bare array of `{ id, name, category, chartType }`. Returns 404 if the ticker has no curated KPIs.

```python
types = client.get_kpi_types("AAPL")
for t in types:
    print(f"  {t.id} ({t.chartType}): {t.name}")
```

---

## Metrics API (`/api/v2/metrics`)

Time series metrics for stocks and entities: mentions, sentiment, social dominance, and more. Computed from serving data with proper entity resolution (tickers are resolved to KB entities automatically).

Every metric type (`mentions`, `sentiment`, `sentisense`, `social_dominance`) is available on the Free tier: no PRO subscription needed. All metrics endpoints are **Quota-gated**: an API key is required and each request counts against your monthly quota (Free: 1,000 requests/month; PRO: no monthly cap). Per-minute rate limits apply on every tier.

### GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{entityId}/metric/{metricType}
Time series metric data for a stock or entity. **Quota-gated** -- all metric types (`mentions`, `sentiment`, `sentisense`, `social_dominance`) are available on the Free tier.

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `entityId` | path | Yes | - | Stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL`) or KB entity ID |
| `metricType` | path | Yes | - | `mentions`, `sentiment`, `sentisense`, `social_dominance` |
| `startTime` | long | No | 7 days ago | Epoch milliseconds |
| `endTime` | long | No | now | Epoch milliseconds |
| `maxDataPoints` | int | No | - | Downsample to N data points |

**Response:** an array of points ordered ascending by `timestamp`. Each point exposes a flat `value` scalar alongside the full `metricValue` object:

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": 1780372800000,
    "metricType": "SENTIMENT",
    "value": 0.42,
    "metricValue": { "type": "ValueMetricValue", "valueType": "MEAN", "value": { "value": 0.42 } }
  }
]
```

Read the scalar from the flat `value` (the polarity for `sentiment`, the count for `mentions`). It saves you walking the nested `metricValue.value` (count metrics) or `metricValue.value.value` (value metrics), whose depth varies by metric type. A point with no reading omits `value`. To derive the current reading and its change: points are time-ascending, so the current value is the last point's `value`, and the change is the last point's `value` minus the prior point's (or minus the first point's for the whole window). A window with 0 or 1 point has no derivable trend, so widen `startTime` rather than reporting a change.

### GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{entityId}/distribution/{metricType}
Distribution of a metric across a dimension (e.g., mentions by source). **Quota-gated**, available on the Free tier.

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `entityId` | path | Yes | - | Stock ticker or KB entity ID |
| `metricType` | path | Yes | - | Metric type key |
| `dimension` | string | Yes | - | Dimension to slice by (e.g., `source`) |
| `startTime` | long | No | 7 days ago | Epoch milliseconds |
| `endTime` | long | No | now | Epoch milliseconds |

### GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{entityId}/metric/{metricType}/mean-by/{dimension}
Mean of a metric per dimension value over a time window (e.g., per-source mean sentiment). **Quota-gated**, available on the Free tier.

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `entityId` | path | Yes | - | Stock ticker or KB entity ID |
| `metricType` | path | Yes | - | Metric type key (e.g., `sentiment`) |
| `dimension` | path | Yes | - | Dimension to group by (e.g., `source`) |
| `startTime` | long | No | 7 days ago | Epoch milliseconds |
| `endTime` | long | No | now | Epoch milliseconds |

Response: flat map of dimension value to mean, e.g. `{ "NEWS": 0.42, "REDDIT": -0.05 }`. For sentiment by source, each value is the average of that source's daily mean readings inside the window; a window with no data returns `{}`. Returns `400` for an unknown metric type or when `startTime` is after `endTime`.

### GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{entityId}/metric/{metricType}/slices
Available slice dimensions for a metric. **Quota-gated**, available on the Free tier.

### GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{entityId}/baselines/{metricType}
Historical and peer baselines for a metric. **Quota-gated**, available on the Free tier.

## Market Mood API (`/api/v2/market-mood`)

SentiSense's proprietary composite market sentiment index. Combines social sentiment, market direction, risk appetite, social momentum, and S&P 500 trend signals into a single 0-100 score with sector breakdown. **Free (API key required).** Free for all tiers, but anonymous calls return 401 api_key_required.

### GET /api/v2/market-mood
Composite market sentiment score with history and sector breakdown.

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|

## Documents & News API (`/api/v1/documents`)

> **Note:** Document responses include a `url` field but **no headline or title text**. The API provides derived analytics (sentiment, entities, reliability), not source content. The `sourceName` field identifies the publisher. If your application needs to display titles, the `url` field links to the original source. Any content retrieval from source URLs is your application's independent action, subject to the source platform's terms. See our [API Terms of Service](https://sentisense.ai/agreement/API-Terms-of-Service.pdf).

### GET /api/v1/documents/ticker/{ticker}

| `hours` | int | No | - | Lookback in hours (overrides days) |
| `limit` | int | No | 200 | Max results (capped at 200) |

Response: `{ documents: [...], totalCount, searchTicker, source, startDate, endDate }`. Each document includes: `id`, `url`, `source`, `sourceName`, `published`, `averageSentiment`, `reliability`, `sentiment[]`. Per-entity sentiment classifies each mentioned entity as POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/NEUTRAL.

| `source` | string | No | all | Filter by source |
| `days` | int | No | 7 | Lookback in days |
| `limit` | int | No | 200 | Max results (capped at 500) |

### GET /api/v1/documents/source/{source}
Latest documents from a specific source. **Public.**

| `days` | int | No | Lookback in days |
| `limit` | int | No | Max results (capped at 500) |
| `sort` | string | No | `latest` (default, newest first) or `top` (reliability-first: recent documents are grouped into freshness buckets and ranked by publisher reliability within each bucket, so high-authority publishers surface first). Any other value returns `400`. |

### GET /api/v1/documents/stories
AI-curated news story clusters. **Public.**

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | int | No | 20 | Max stories (capped at 50) |
| `days` | int | No | 7 | Lookback in days (max 15) |

Response: Story objects with a top-level `id` AND `clusterId` (both equal to the cluster id -- pass either to `/documents/stories/{clusterId}`), plus `cluster.title`, `cluster.averageSentiment`, `tickers`, `displayTickers`, `impactScore` (0-10), `brokeAt` (epoch seconds, nullable), `cluster.clusteredAt` (epoch seconds). Use `tickers` (bare symbols, e.g. `["AAPL"]`) programmatically; `displayTickers` are human-formatted labels (e.g. `["Apple Inc (AAPL)"]`) for display only, do not parse symbols out of them. The `cluster.createdAt` field (epoch millis) is deprecated and will be removed on or after 2026-08-16; use `cluster.clusteredAt`.

### GET /api/v1/documents/stories/ticker/{ticker}
News stories for a specific stock. **Public.**

### GET /api/v1/documents/stories/{clusterId}
Full detail for a single story cluster. **Public** -- Free: 10 story views/month, PRO: unlimited. Each list item from `/stories` and `/stories/ticker/{ticker}` carries a top-level `id` AND a `clusterId` (both equal to the cluster id); pass either one here as `{clusterId}`.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `clusterId` | path | Yes | Story cluster ID (from `/stories` or `/stories/ticker/{ticker}`) |

Response: a flat story object (no `{isPreview, data}` wrapper) containing SentiSense-generated content and derived data only: `id`, `createdAt`, `lastUpdatedAt`; AI-written content (`title`, `summarizedContent`, `narrativeBody`, `bullishView`, `bearishView`, `aspectPerspectives`); `citationLinks` (map of `docN` markdown references in `narrativeBody` to public article URLs); computed metrics (`averageSentiment`, `momentumScore`, `aiConfidence`); source metadata (`clusterSize`, `sourcesList`, `primaryCategory`, `dominantEventType`, `publishersList`, `primaryPublisher`, `topPublishers`); `tickers`, `displayTickers`, `primaryEntityNames`, `relatedEntities`; `archived`, `totalDocuments`.

Consistent with the documents policy above, publisher headlines, article text, and images are never included: the `title` and narrative are AI-generated by SentiSense, and `citationLinks` point to the original sources.

## Institutional Flows API (`/api/v1/institutional`)

Data from SEC 13F-HR filings. Filer categories: `INDEX_FUND`, `HEDGE_FUND`, `ACTIVIST`, `PENSION`, `BANK`, `INSURANCE`, `MUTUAL_FUND`, `SOVEREIGN_WEALTH`, `ENDOWMENT`, `OTHER`.

**Important:** All institutional endpoints (except `/quarters`) require a `reportDate` parameter. **Always call `GET /quarters` first** to get valid dates; do not hardcode them. Use the `reportDate` from the first quarter with `pending:false` in subsequent calls (skip the still-filing `pending:true` quarter; see `/quarters` below).

### GET /api/v1/institutional/quarters
Available 13F reporting quarters. **Public.** Call this first.

Response: array of `{ value, label, reportDate, pending }` objects sorted newest-first. `pending` is a boolean. Use the `reportDate` of the first quarter with `pending:false`; the most-recent quarter is `pending:true` while inside the 45-day 13F filing window and holds only early filers. Pass that `reportDate` (e.g., `"2025-12-31"`) when calling other institutional endpoints.

### GET /api/v1/institutional/flows
Aggregate institutional buying/selling per ticker. **Public (preview)** -- Free: top 5, PRO: full data.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `reportDate` | ISO date | Yes | The `reportDate` from `/quarters` (e.g., `2025-12-31`) |
| `limit` | int | No | Max results per direction (default: 50, max: 100) |

Response: `{ isPreview, previewReason, data: { inflows: [...], outflows: [...] } }`. Each flow includes net share changes, new/closed positions, and per-category breakdowns (indexFundNetChange, hedgeFundNetChange, etc.). Flows are ranked by `dollarFlowUsd` (= `netSharesChange × avgClosePrice`): inflows DESC, outflows ASC. `avgClosePrice` is null and `dollarFlowUsd` is 0 for tickers without a cached quarterly price; clients should fall back to `netSharesChange` for those rows.

### GET /api/v1/institutional/holders/{ticker}
Institutional holders for a stock. **Public (preview)** -- Free: top 5, PRO: full data.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `reportDate` | ISO date | Yes | Quarter end date |
| `limit` | int | No | Page size (1-1000). When present, returns a sorted page plus `returnedCount`/`offset` and a `notableChanges` summary; when omitted, returns the full list (legacy). Mega-caps have 5,000+ holders, so paging is recommended. |
| `offset` | int | No | Page start within the sorted list (default 0; used with `limit`) |
| `sortBy` | string | No | `shares` (default), `valueUsd`, or `sharesChangePct` (used with `limit`) |
| `sortDir` | string | No | `desc` (default) or `asc` (used with `limit`) |

Response: `{ isPreview, previewReason, data: { ticker, companyName, reportDate, totalInstitutionalShares, holderCount, holders: [...] } }`. The holder list is nested at `data.holders` (not `data` directly). Each holder includes filer name, category, shares, value, change type (NEW/INCREASED/DECREASED/SOLD_OUT/UNCHANGED). `holderCount` is always the full-quarter count; on paged requests `data` also carries `returnedCount`, `offset`, and `notableChanges` (`{count, top}`: holders with a 10%+ change on 10k+ shares, top 5 by dollar impact).

### GET /api/v1/institutional/activist
Activist investor positions (NEW or INCREASED stakes). **Public (preview)** -- Free: top 3, PRO: full data.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

### GET /api/v1/institutional/options
Institutional options activity with call/put breakdown. **Public (preview)** -- Free: top 3, PRO: full data.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `reportDate` | ISO date | Yes | Quarter end date |

### GET /api/v1/institutional/institutions
Discover the universe of institutions: paginated, AUM-ranked list of filers (slug + metadata) so you can find what to query without knowing slugs upfront. Each institution is rolled up by parent filer, so a multi-filer manager (e.g. Vanguard) appears once with combined AUM. Summary only; use `/institution/{slugOrCik}` for full holdings. **API key required, quota-exempt** (per-minute rate limits still apply); full list for every key holder.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `category` | string | No | Filer category: `INDEX_FUND`, `HEDGE_FUND`, `ACTIVIST`, `PENSION`, `BANK`, `INSURANCE`, `MUTUAL_FUND`, `SOVEREIGN_WEALTH`, `ENDOWMENT`, `OTHER` |
| `minAumUsd` | long | No | Minimum total AUM in USD (e.g. `10000000000`) |
| `limit` | int | No | Page size (default: 50, max: 200) |
| `offset` | int | No | Pagination offset (default: 0) |
| `sort` | string | No | `aumDesc` (default), `aumAsc`, or `nameAsc`. Deterministic ordering, so pagination is stable. |
| `quarter` | string | No | AUM snapshot quarter as `YYYYQN` (e.g. `2026Q1`); defaults to latest. |

Response: `{ isPreview, previewReason, data: { quarter, totalCount, offset, limit, institutions: [...] } }`. `isPreview` is always false here. Each institution: `cik, urlSlug, displayName, filerCategory, totalValueUsd, holdingsCount, multiCikRollup, childCikCount`. Bad inputs (unknown category/sort, negative offset/minAumUsd, quarter with no data) return 400.

### GET /api/v1/institutional/institution/{slugOrCik}
Full profile, summary stats, and current-quarter equity holdings for a specific institutional filer. Resolved by URL slug (e.g. `Berkshire-Hathaway`) or numeric CIK (e.g. `1067983`). **PRO (preview)** -- Free: profile + top 10 holdings, PRO: full holdings array. Returns 404 if the slug or CIK is unknown.

Response: `{ isPreview, previewReason, data: { filerCik, displayName, urlSlug, filerCategory, totalValueUsd, holdingsCount, latestReportDate, quartersTracked, newPositions, increasedPositions, decreasedPositions, soldOutPositions, multiCikRollup, childCikCount, childCiks, holdings: [...] } }`. `multiCikRollup`/`childCikCount`/`childCiks` describe parent/subsidiary rollups (e.g. Vanguard) and are present for all tiers (`childCiks` is null when not a rollup). Holding objects include `ticker, companyName, shares, valueUsd, changeType, sharesChange, sharesChangePct, portfolioWeight`.

## Insider Trading API (`/api/v1/insider`)

SEC Form 4 insider trading data: track buys, sells, awards, and exercises by company officers, directors, and 10%+ shareholders. Updated daily. Includes cluster buy detection (a historically bullish signal).

**Insider relationships:** `OFFICER`, `DIRECTOR`, `TEN_PCT_OWNER`, `OTHER`. Each filer also has independent `officer`, `director`, `tenPctOwner` booleans (a person can be both officer and director).

**Transaction types:** `BUY`, `SELL`, `EXERCISE`, `AWARD`, `GIFT`, `OTHER`. To count open-market activity, filter `transactionType` to `BUY` or `SELL`; `AWARD` (grants), `GIFT`, and `EXERCISE` are not open-market trades and should be excluded from a buys/sells tally. Note the insider endpoint uses `BUY`/`SELL`, NOT the politician endpoint's `PURCHASE`/`SALE` vocabulary (a filter written for one returns zero on the other).

### GET /api/v1/insider/activity
Market-wide insider buying and selling aggregated by ticker. **Public (preview)** -- Free: top 5, PRO: full data.

Congressional STOCK Act trading disclosures: purchases, sales, and exercises by U.S. Senators and Representatives. Updated daily from official filings.

**Chambers:** `SENATE`, `HOUSE`.

**Transaction types:** `PURCHASE`, `SALE`, `EXCHANGE`, `OTHER`.

**Amount ranges:** STOCK Act disclosures report dollar amounts as ranges (e.g., "$1,001 - $15,000"), not exact values. The API returns the raw range string plus parsed `amountMin`/`amountMax`.

### GET /api/v1/politicians/activity

## Insights API (`/api/v1/insights`)

AI-generated signals for stocks and the overall market. Each insight identifies a specific pattern: insider cluster buying, institutional position changes, volume anomalies, sentiment baseline deviations, and more. Most lists are sorted by urgency then confidence; the per-stock endpoint (`/stock/{ticker}`) is ranked by importance (relevance, confidence, and recency) so fresh signals lead.

**Insight fields:** `insightId`, `insightType`, `category` (`SENTIMENT`/`TRENDING`/`TECHNICAL`/`FUNDAMENTAL`/`PERSONALIZED`), `insightText`, `confidence` (0.0-1.0), `urgency` (`low`/`medium`/`high`), `generatedAt` (epoch seconds), `docRefs` (`[{url, type}]`).

Wall Street analyst coverage: aggregate price target band, buy/hold/sell distribution, recent upgrade/downgrade actions, and forward EPS estimates with earnings surprise history. Free users still get the price target band (`targetLow`, `targetMean`, `targetHigh`, `numberOfAnalysts`, `consensusLabel`) in full -- it powers the public projection cone. The buy/hold/sell distribution counts and full action/estimate history are PRO-only.

### GET /api/v1/analyst/{ticker}/consensus

## ETFs API (`/api/v1/etfs`)

ETF discovery, composition (holdings), and holdings-weighted aggregate views. Funds aren't rated by analysts directly and don't have insiders of their own, so the aggregate endpoints synthesize fund-level views from each constituent's per-stock data, weighted by allocation. Every aggregate response carries a `coverage` block so consumers see how much of the fund's AUM the underlying data covered.

**Coverage**: a growing set of widely-traded funds (SPY, QQQ, IWM, VOO, VTI, major SPDR sectors, etc.). Expect coverage and aggregate freshness to keep improving.

### GET /api/v1/etfs
List every ETF SentiSense tracks. Sorted by ticker. **Discovery (no quota cost)** -- API key required, but the call does not consume your monthly quota. No parameters. This exemption applies to this list endpoint only; the per-ticker ETF endpoints below (holdings, quote, aggregates) count against monthly quota as usual.

Response: `Array<{ ticker, name, kbEntityId, urlSlug, issuer, trackedIndex, assetClass }>`.

### GET /api/v1/etfs/{ticker}/holdings
Full composition of an ETF: per-holding weights, freshness timestamps, partial-coverage signal. **Free tier** (API key required).

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ticker` | path | Yes | ETF ticker (e.g. `QQQ`) |

Response: `{ ticker, issuer, issuerEndpoint, asOfDate (ISO date), fetchedAt (epoch seconds), nextRefreshDue (ISO date), totalHoldings, holdings: [{ ticker, name, weightPct, firstSeen (ISO date) }], partial?, totalKnownHoldings? }`. Returns 404 for unknown ETFs or commodity-only funds (e.g. GLD) without equity holdings.

### GET /api/v1/etfs/{ticker}/quote
Aggregate ETF detail-page quote: live price, today OHLC, 52-week range, trailing-12-month dividend yield, AUM, expense ratio, NAV, inception date. Peer of `/api/v1/stocks/{ticker}/quote` for fund tickers. **API key required.**

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ticker` | path | Yes | ETF ticker (e.g. `VTI`) |

Response: `{ ticker, currentPrice, change, changePercent, volume, open, dayHigh, dayLow, previousClose, week52High, week52Low, dividendYield, aum, expenseRatio, nav, inceptionDate (ISO date), timestamp, extendedHours? }` -- all fields except `ticker` are nullable. `aum` is the ETF analogue of `marketCap` on the stock quote. `expenseRatio` and `dividendYield` are decimals (e.g. `0.0003` for 0.03%). Cached 15 s server-side.

Stock tickers (e.g. `AAPL`) return `400 ticker_is_not_etf` from this endpoint. Use `GET /api/v1/stocks/{ticker}/quote` instead.

### GET /api/v1/etfs/{ticker}/aggregates/analyst
Holdings-weighted analyst consensus for an ETF, derived from per-stock coverage of each constituent. Math: weight × per-stock upside, renormalized to the covered subset. **API key required.** Returns the full response (including `topContributors`) to every API caller; tiers differ only in per-tier rate limits and quota.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ticker` | path | Yes | ETF ticker |

Response: `{ isPreview, previewReason, data: { ticker, asOfDate (ISO date), computedAt (epoch seconds), coverage: { holdingsCount, holdingsCovered, weightCovered, partial?, totalKnownHoldings? }, weightedConsensus: { upsidePercent, consensusLabel ("BUY"|"HOLD"|"SELL"), distribution: { BUY: 0.62, HOLD: 0.31, SELL: 0.07 }, totalAnalysts }, topContributors: [{ ticker, weightPct, upsidePercent, consensusLabel, contributionPp }] } }`. Returns 404 when not an ETF or when covered AUM is too low to publish (typically foreign-listed funds).

### GET /api/v1/etfs/{ticker}/aggregates/insider
Holdings-weighted SEC Form 4 insider activity for an ETF over a configurable window. **API key required.** Returns the full response (including `topContributors`) to every API caller.

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ticker` | path | Yes | - | ETF ticker |
| `lookbackDays` | int | No | 30 | Trailing window (typical: 30 or 90) |

Response: `{ isPreview, previewReason, data: { ticker, asOfDate (ISO date), computedAt (epoch seconds), lookbackDays, coverage, weightedNetFlow: { netDollars (signed), buyDollars, sellDollars, buyTradeCount, sellTradeCount, distinctInsiderCount }, topContributors: [{ ticker, weightPct, netDollars, weightedNetDollars, tradeCount }] } }`.

### GET /api/v1/etfs/{ticker}/aggregates/sentiment
Two SentiSense Score readings side-by-side: constituent-weighted (precomputed daily across the fund's holdings) and direct (mentions of the ETF's own ticker). The two can diverge meaningfully and the gap is itself informative. Covers a growing set of widely-traded funds (SPY, QQQ, VOO, VTI, IWM, major SPDR sector funds, and more). Returns 404 for funds outside the current coverage window. **API key required.**

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ticker` | path | Yes | ETF ticker |

Response: `{ isPreview, previewReason, data: { ticker, asOfDate (ISO date), computedAt (epoch seconds), coverage, constituentsWeighted: { sentiSenseScore, scoreLabel ("BULLISH"|"NEUTRAL"|"BEARISH"), asOfTimestamp (epoch seconds) }, direct: { ...same shape... } | null } }`. The `direct` block can be null for low-mention funds. Returns 404 when the constituent-weighted metric hasn't been produced for the ticker yet.

| `topActiveStocks` | string[] | Most active tickers by mention volume |
| `lastUpdated` | long | Epoch milliseconds when data was last updated |

## Trackers API (`/api/v1/trackers`)

Observational data products. Every tracker returns the same standardized envelope, so one renderer per `viewType` covers every current and future SentiSense tracker. Full docs: <https://sentisense.ai/docs/api/trackers>.

### GET /api/v1/trackers
Discovery listing of every publicly-visible tracker.

Response: `{"trackers": TrackerListing[]}` where each `TrackerListing` has:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `trackerId` | string | Slug for the detail endpoint |
| `displayName` | string | Hub-card title |
| `category` | string | Coarse grouping (`institutional`, etc.) |
| `description` | string | One-sentence subtitle |
| `viewType` | string | Renderer hint. Phase 1 publishes `table` |
| `accessTier` | string | `free` or `pro`. `pro` trackers truncate to a free preview for FREE callers; `free` trackers return the full snapshot to everyone |
| `methodologyAnchor` | string | Fragment on `/methodology` for the tracker |
| `refreshIntervalSeconds` | int | Expected refresh cadence |
| `canonicalUrl` | string | Detail endpoint path |

### GET /api/v1/trackers/{trackerId}
Standardized snapshot envelope for one tracker. Returns:

```
{"isPreview": false, "previewReason": null, "data": TrackerSnapshot}
```

A `pro` tracker served to a FREE caller truncates `rows[]` and sets `isPreview: true, previewReason: "PRO_REQUIRED"` plus `totalCount`; `free` trackers and PRO callers get the full snapshot. Where `TrackerSnapshot` has `trackerId`, `displayName`, `viewType`, `asOf`, `headline[]` (top-of-page stat tiles), and one payload field per `viewType`:

| `viewType` | Payload field | Per-item shape |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| `table` | `rows[]` | `{rank, rowId, name, category?, url?, metrics[]}` where each metric is `{label, value, unit}` |

Live trackers as of this writing, all `viewType: table`. The catalog grows over time: treat the `GET /api/v1/trackers` discovery endpoint as the source of truth, not this table.

| Tracker id | accessTier | What it ranks |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `reddit-picks` | free | Stocks finance-Reddit turned bullish on, scored on return since entry vs SPY |
| `institution-concentration` | free | 13F filers by share of the book held in their top 10 positions |
| `institution-aum` | free | Largest 13F filers by disclosed long-equity AUM |
| `hedge-fund-reported-returns` | pro | Net-of-fee annual returns large hedge funds publish, with citations |
| `media-darlings` | free | Stocks by how bullish or bearish the curated financial press is on them |
| `sentiment-leaderboard` | free | Most bullish and most bearish stocks by pure sentiment polarity |
| `sentiment-movers` | free | Biggest 7-day sentiment shifts, improving and deteriorating |
| `trending-products` | free | Products and services by mention volume and week-over-week growth |

Column headers are the metric labels on `rows[0]`. Common metric `unit` values are `percent`, `usd`, and `count`; newer trackers add richer units such as `polarity`, `ratio`, `status`, and `sparkline`.

Errors: `404 unknown_tracker`, `404 no_snapshot`, `503 tracker_unavailable`.

## Calendar API (`/api/v1/calendar`)

Forward-looking market calendars. Earnings is the first feed; the `/calendar/{type}` namespace is built to grow. The value is lead time: not what reports tonight, but which companies report over the next several weeks, with consensus EPS and confirmation status attached, so you can position ahead of the event. API key required on every call.

### GET /api/v1/calendar
Discover which calendars are available. **Discovery (no quota cost)** -- API key required, does not burn monthly quota.

Response: `{ calendars: [ { type, path, description } ] }`. Today: `earnings`.

### GET /api/v1/calendar/earnings
Upcoming company earnings, sorted by date. **Public (preview)** -- Free: current week, PRO: full forward window (about 30 days). Field richness is identical across tiers; the gate is how far ahead you can see, not which columns you get. Defaults to the current week onward; pass an earlier `from` to include already-reported earnings.

| Param | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ticker` | string | No | - | Filter to a single ticker |
| `week` | string | No | - | Shorthand window: `this` or `next` |
| `from` | string | No | - | Inclusive lower bound, ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` (overrides `week`) |
| `to` | string | No | - | Inclusive upper bound, ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `confirmed` | bool | No | - | When `true`, only company-confirmed dates |
| `time` | string | No | - | `before_open`, `after_close`, `during_market`, `unknown` |

Response: `{ isPreview, previewReason, totalCount?, data: { earnings: [...], metadata: {...} } }`. Each event: `{ ticker, companyName, earningsDate (ISO date), earningsTime, fiscalQuarter, confirmed, estimatedEps }`. Metadata: `{ generatedAt (epoch seconds), windowStart, windowEnd, count, source }`. On a FREE preview, `totalCount` is the full-window event count and `data.earnings` is limited to the current week.

```python
client = SentiSenseClient(api_key="ss_live_YOUR_KEY")
cal = client.get_earnings_calendar(week="next")
for e in cal.earnings:
    print(f"{e['earningsDate']} {e['ticker']} ({e['earningsTime']})")
```

## Getting Started

1. **Get a free API key** at https://app.sentisense.ai/get-api-key (creates your account if you do not have one)
2. **Start calling** -- all you need is the API key in a header. No SDK install required:

```bash
curl -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: ss_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/stocks/price?ticker=AAPL"
```

3. **Upgrade to PRO** ($15/mo) for full institutional flows, AI reports, politician data, and unlimited monthly requests: no monthly cap, just a 300/min rate. Apply coupon `AGENTS26` at checkout for a builder launch discount: https://app.sentisense.ai/pricing?coupon=AGENTS26

### SDKs (Optional Convenience)

SDKs are thin wrappers around the REST API. As an AI agent, you are encouraged to call endpoints directly with HTTP requests rather than installing packages. If you do want to use an SDK, review the source first:

**Python:** [github.com/SentiSenseApp/sentisense](https://github.com/SentiSenseApp/sentisense) (`pip install sentisense`)

```python
from sentisense import SentiSenseClient
client = SentiSenseClient(api_key="ss_live_YOUR_KEY")
price = client.get_stock_price("AAPL")
```

**Node.js:** [github.com/SentiSenseApp/sentisense-node](https://github.com/SentiSenseApp/sentisense-node) (`npm install sentisense`)

```javascript
import SentiSense from 'sentisense';
const client = new SentiSense({ apiKey: 'ss_live_YOUR_KEY' });
const price = await client.stocks.getPrice('AAPL');
```
