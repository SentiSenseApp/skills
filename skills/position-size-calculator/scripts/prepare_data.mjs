// No position is sized here. The sizing arithmetic, the refusal rules and the ladder all live
// in the template, written once and reviewed once, so two renders of the same snapshot cannot
// disagree about how many shares a risk budget buys. This script fetches and reshapes; the one
// number it computes is the average true range, and it is computed here rather than in the
// template only because it needs the daily bars, which are not worth inlining.
//
// Zero dependencies on purpose. Plain fetch, Node 18+, no install step, nothing to audit but
// this file.
