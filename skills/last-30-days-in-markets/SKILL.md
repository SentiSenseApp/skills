## What this skill is for

Deep research on a month of market history: fetch the data first, then synthesize it, so every claim
in the output traces back to a response pulled during the run.

That is the whole point, and it is what separates this from the fast answer. Ask a search engine or
a general assistant what happened in the markets last month and you get a fluent paragraph
assembled from training recall plus whatever pages got scraped: no stated coverage window, no impact
ranking, no way for the reader to tell which parts were measured and which were remembered. It reads
authoritative and it cannot be checked.

This skill takes the opposite trade deliberately. It is slower, it spends about twenty API calls,
and it will tell the reader when the data does not reach, which parts of the month are thin, and
what it could not cover. In exchange the reader gets something auditable: dated events ranked by a
real impact score, a numeric mood series they can plot, and an explicit coverage line. Use it when
the answer matters enough to be checked.

For "just today's screen", hand off to the `stock-terminal` skill when available. Pass the focus or tickers and relevant already-fetched context. Return a compact current view without another month-long fetch. Hand off only when the user changes the question; do not automatically route back. If the sibling is unavailable, answer the supported part here using a connected tool or the inline REST workflow, state any remaining gap, and never require an install.

The material it works from is unusual, and worth understanding before writing anything. This API
returns **no publisher headlines and no article text**. It returns *story clusters*: groups of
related coverage clustered and titled by SentiSense's own models, each carrying an impact score, an
aggregate sentiment, and the tickers involved, alongside real numeric series for the market's mood.

That constraint is also the product. A recap built from clusters tells you which *themes* dominated
a month and how much they mattered, which is what a person actually wants after three weeks away. A
list of headlines is available anywhere.

So the standard throughout is simple: **if a statement cannot be supported from the fetched data, it
does not go in the brief.** The rules below are what that standard means in practice.

## The fan-out

Fetch everything first, then write once. Six layers, four of which answer different questions about
the same 30 days.

| Layer | Call | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| **The arc** | `GET /api/v2/market-mood?days=30` | How the market felt, day by day, and which signal drove each turn |
| **Theme indexes** | `GET /api/v1/indexes` then `GET /api/v1/indexes/{indexId}/history?days=30` | Whether a named theme (AI complex, Fed) ran hot or cold across the month |
| **The events** | `GET /api/v1/documents/stories?filterHours=720&limit=50&offset=N` | What was actually being discussed, clustered and impact-ranked |
| **Signals** | `GET /api/v1/insights/latest?limit=200` | Insider, institutional, sentiment and volume signals that fired |
| **Where it stands** | `GET /api/v1/market-summary` and `GET /api/v1/insights/market` | The standing read. Both are batch surfaces, recomputed on a schedule rather than per tick, so report their `generatedAt` age rather than presenting them as this moment |
| **What is next** | `GET /api/v1/calendar/earnings` | The forward close |

About **20 calls** for a full brief, roughly a dozen of them story pages. On the Free tier that is
comfortably inside the monthly allowance but close to the **30 requests per minute** ceiling once
you add story pages, so run the story paging serially and the rest concurrently rather than firing
all of it at once.

Two different `429`s, two different responses. A per-minute `rate_limit_exceeded` carries
`Retry-After: 60`: honor it, wait, and resume the fan-out where it stopped. A monthly
`quota_exceeded` carries **no** `Retry-After` header and retrying does not help: stop fetching,
write the brief from the layers you already have, and state the missing layers in the coverage
line rather than pretending they came back.

### Getting a real 30-day story window

`days` is not the lookback control on `/documents/stories`. **Set the window with `filterHours`**:
`720` is 30 days, `336` is 14, `168` is a week. Then page with `offset`, `limit=50` per page.

**Page the whole window, then de-duplicate by `id`.** The paging rule is one rule: keep
requesting the next `offset` until a page comes back with **fewer rows than `limit`**, or empty.
A 30-day window currently holds close to 600 clusters, so expect about a dozen pages of 50 before
the short page arrives. Do not stop earlier to save requests. With `filterHours` set, the feed is
ranked by curation score across the whole window, so every page spans the whole month: a partial
fetch looks complete from its dates while it drops clusters at every impact level, including some
of the month's highest-impact ones, and it skews the ticker counts. Pages are built to be
disjoint, but keep a set of seen `id`s anyway before you count or rank anything, so a repeated
row can never inflate a ticker count or appear twice in a top-N. Report fetched versus unique in
the coverage line ("[rows] rows, [unique] unique clusters").

**Identify your client.** Send a `User-Agent` naming your agent runtime and this skill, for
example `OpenClaw/1.4 (last-30-days-in-markets)` or `ClaudeCode/2.1 (last-30-days-in-markets)`. Substitute your own runtime and
version if neither matches. You can also volunteer what your agent is called by adding an
`agent/<your-agent-name>` token inside the same parentheses, as in
`OpenClaw/1.4 (last-30-days-in-markets; agent/research-desk)`. All of it is optional, and it is what tells
us this skill has real integrations behind it, so it gets prioritized and you get notice before it
changes.

```bash
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/documents/stories?filterHours=720&limit=50&offset=0"
```

Then repeat with `offset=50`, `offset=100` and so on, under the paging rule above. If a quota
error stops the paging early, the coverage line says how many pages came back and that the
ranking and ticker counts are partial.

Every field the brief is allowed to use comes off the story object:

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `id` / `clusterId` | Both equal the cluster id; pass either to `/documents/stories/{clusterId}` for full detail |
| `cluster.title` | The SentiSense-written cluster title. The only headline-shaped string the brief may print |
| `cluster.averageSentiment` | Aggregate tone of the coverage in the cluster, -1 to +1 |
| `impactScore` | 0 to 10; the sort key for any "biggest of the month" ranking |
| `tickers` | Bare symbols (e.g. `["AAPL"]`), for programmatic use |
| `displayTickers` | Human-formatted labels for display only; never parse symbols out of them |
| `brokeAt` | Epoch **seconds**, nullable: when the story broke |
| `cluster.clusteredAt` | Epoch **seconds**, always present: when it was clustered |

Two details that decide whether the timeline is right:

- **Date each cluster off `brokeAt` when present, falling back to `cluster.clusteredAt`.** The two
  can differ by hours; `brokeAt` is the event time and `clusteredAt` is the processing time, so
  prefer the event time and use the always-present `clusteredAt` when `brokeAt` is null. Do not use
  the deprecated `cluster.createdAt`, which is in epoch milliseconds. Convert once, at fetch time,
  and carry a real date on every cluster from then on.
- **With `filterHours` the feed is ordered by curation score, not by date and not by impact.** Sort
  by `impactScore` yourself for any "biggest of the month" section, and sort by date for the
  timeline. Two different orderings of the same list, both needed.

### The month in one subject

When the ask names a subject rather than the whole market ("the month in tariffs", "what happened
with the fed decision", "AI capex over the last month"), search the story corpus directly instead of
paging the whole feed and filtering it yourself. When the subject is one stock, use the ticker
filter in "One ticker's month" below instead: search is row-capped and can stop short of a busy
name's month.

```bash
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/documents/stories/search?query=fed+decision&days=30"
```

`query` is free text and required; a blank one is a `400`. `days` is the lookback, 1 to 30, default
7, so pass `days=30` for the month. `limit` defaults to 20 and caps at 50, and there is no `offset`.
The rows are the same slim story objects the feed returns, newest first, so the field table above
and every rule in this skill apply to them unchanged. Because the result is capped and newest
first, a full page of results usually means the subject has more stories than you received: the
oldest returned date, not `days=30`, is where your coverage starts, so print it.

Write the query the way the parser reads it. Entities recognized in the text (tickers, company
names, people, organizations, products, topics) are searched first, and whatever words are left
over become keywords that must all appear in a story's own title or summary, at most four of them
once stopwords are dropped. If the entity pass finds nothing, the search retries on keywords alone.
So a short subject phrase beats a sentence, and two or three distinctive words beat five vague ones.
Read the titles before you trust the set, in both directions: an entity match can be broader than
the word you typed, and a leftover keyword can be narrower than you meant (`fed decision` keeps only
stories whose own text says "decision", so a story titled around a rate hike can drop out). Pass
`limit=50`, keep the hits whose titles are about the subject, and try a shorter or different
phrase when the obvious stories are missing.

Search narrows, it does not summarize. **Keep the paged feed as the spine of the brief**: the impact
ranking, the ticker counts and the coverage line are built from it, while a search result set is a
subset with no claim to cover the month. Use search to go deep on the subject the reader asked
about, and report its own first and last observed dates in the coverage line like any other layer.

### Reading the arc

`GET /api/v2/market-mood?days=30` returns the current score and phase, a `signals[]` breakdown of
the component signals behind the latest reading, **and** a daily `history` array carrying the
composite plus a column per component signal. That one response is the entire quantitative spine,
so fetch it first and let it set the shape of the brief.

- Scale is 0 to 100, fear to greed. Phases: 0-15 Extreme Fear, 16-30 Fear, 31-45 Anxiety, 46-55
  Neutral, 56-70 Optimism, 71-85 Greed, 86-100 Extreme Greed.
- **Iterate the signals the response actually contains.** `signals[]` lists only the signals present
  in the latest reading, so key off each entry's `key` (using its `label` for display) rather than
  hardcoding a signal list or a count: the composite's membership has changed before and can change
  again. In `history` rows, a `null` component value means that signal was not part of the index on
  that date; treat it as absent, never as zero, and never average it in.
- **`history` names the same signals in camelCase.** A `signals[]` key is snake_case and its
  `history` column is the camelCase form of it: `fear_gauge` is the `fearGauge` column,
  `spy_trend` is `spyTrend`, `social_sentiment` is `socialSentiment`. Convert the key before you
  look a column up; a lookup by the raw key finds nothing, and that is not the same as a `null`.
- **Risk Appetite (`key: fear_gauge`) reads backwards from expectation.** It is an inverse
  volatility gauge, so a *high* value means a calm, risk-on market. Label it when you use it or you
  will invert the month's story.
- **History skips weekends.** A 30-day request returns roughly 20 points, and weekends are
  absent by construction rather than missing. Do not interpolate across them and do not report "20
  of 30 days" as a data gap. Market holidays are not removed: a weekday holiday such as Labor Day
  can carry a reading of its own. Keep such a row only if you label it as a holiday reading.

For theme indexes, call `GET /api/v1/indexes` for the live list rather than hardcoding ids, then
pull history for the ones relevant to the month. **Read each index's `scale` field instead of
assuming its range**: `SENTIMENT` is signed, -1 to +1, while `PERCENT_0_100` is 0 to 100, and the
listing and history responses both carry the field. Never plot or compare two series on one axis
unless their scales match. Thin buckets are withheld rather than published, so a gap in an index
history is real: plot against `date`, never assume a fixed interval, and never read a missing date
as zero.

### Free tier shaping

Several of these are preview-gated and return `{isPreview, previewReason, totalCount, data}`. Read
`data`, and read `isPreview` and `totalCount` too:

- `insights/latest` returns the top 5 on Free, the full list on PRO.
- `insights/market` returns the top 5 on Free.
- `calendar/earnings` returns one Monday-to-Sunday week on Free: the current week for a bare call,
  next week with `week=next`. PRO gets about a 60-day window. On both tiers a bare call starts on
  the Monday of the current week, so later in the week its first rows are names that have already
  reported. `metadata.windowStart` and `metadata.windowEnd` describe the window you actually got,
  so read them rather than assuming.

**A preview is a slice, not the window.** When `isPreview` is true and `totalCount` is larger than
the rows returned, label the layer with both numbers ("top 5 of 200 insights, free preview") and
never infer absence from it: a signal type, a name or an earnings date missing from the slice may
still be in the window. On the Free calendar, an empty or short list with a larger `totalCount`
means the rest falls outside the free week, not that nothing is scheduled. The brief never quietly
presents the top 5 as though it were the whole month.

---

## What earns a place in the brief

A brief that breaks one of these is wrong even when every number in it is right, because the reader
loses the one thing this skill is for: knowing that what they are reading was measured.

**No headline and no number that did not come back from the API.** Every headline-shaped
string in the brief is either a `cluster.title` copied **verbatim** from a fetched story object, or
a section heading you wrote to describe your own grouping, and every figure is a field value from a
fetched response. You may not write a sentence that reads as a news headline about an event that is
not in the fetched data, and you may not supply a figure the fan-out never returned. The fan-out
carries **no price series and no index returns for the month**: `spy_trend` is a 0-100 signal
score, not a return, so a claim like "the S&P fell 3% mid-month" cannot come from this data and
must not appear, however confidently remembered. The one exception is the `market-summary` prose,
which can quote the latest session's index or ETF moves; those figures belong to its snapshot (see
"Where it stands today") and never to the month's arc. If you find yourself writing what a headline
"probably said", or filling in a price move from background knowledge, you have left the data and
are fabricating. Model-memory
recall of a month's news is exactly the failure this law exists to stop.

**Never attribute to a publisher, and never quote article text.** The permitted vocabulary
for an event is the cluster's own title, its date, its `impactScore`, its `cluster.averageSentiment`
and its `tickers`. Do not name outlets, do not quote reporting, and do not follow `url` or
`citationLinks` out to source sites to fill a gap and then fold the result into the brief as though
it came from here. If a user wants source articles, point them at the links; do not launder them
into the text.

**State the coverage you got, not the coverage you asked for.** Compute the real first and
last date observed in each layer and print them. Three specific traps: mood history skips weekends;
index history withholds thin buckets; story paging stops when a short page comes back, which
can happen before 30 days if the window is quiet. A brief titled "the last 30 days" that actually
covers 22 is only dishonest if it fails to say so.

**Snapshot endpoints describe now, never then.** `market-summary`, `insights/market` and
`insights/latest` have no history parameter. They are the current read. Never write a dated,
past-tense claim out of them ("on the 14th the market was worried about..."). Only the mood and
index history series and the story cluster timestamps may carry a date claim.

**Different snapshots regenerate on different schedules, so same-day values can disagree.** The
mood endpoint's current score and a mood figure quoted inside `market-summary` prose are computed
at different moments; on a moving day they can differ by several points without either being
wrong. When two surfaces disagree, compare their as-of times and show each figure with its own
age rather than presenting one coherent "right now" that the data does not support. The
summary's as-of is its `generatedAt` (epoch seconds); its `lastUpdated` is the time of your own
request, so it is never an age. The mood endpoint carries no timestamp field; its as-of is the
`date` of the last `history` row.

**Every event line carries its date.** A month-long brief whose events are undated is a pile,
not a timeline. Date, cluster title, impact, tickers. In that order, every time.

**Report the pattern; do not manufacture the cause.** This is the easiest rule to break while
technically obeying every other one, because it does not require inventing a single fact: real
clusters and a real mood move get stitched together with a motive the data never supplied.

Two concrete limits, both testable by rereading your own sentence:

- **"Coincided with" is the strongest connective available.** Not "driven by", "on the back of",
  "as investors reacted to", "amid growing appetite for", or "reflecting". Those assert a mechanism,
  and no field in this fan-out measures one. If removing the connective phrase would change the
  claim, the claim is an interpretation and does not belong.
- **A theme must be nameable from the clusters themselves.** Group by what the fetched objects
  actually share: a repeated ticker, a sector, a recurring subject in the titles. A label like
  "growing enthusiasm for the AI buildout" that spans two unrelated clusters is a thesis you
  supplied, however plausible it sounds, and it will read to the user as though the data said it.
  If you cannot point at the specific clusters that make the grouping true, drop it.

And if the month was quiet, the brief says the month was quiet. Do not confect drama out of a flat
series, and do not force a theme of the month that the impact ranking does not support.

**The closing block is mandatory and fixed.** Attribution, coverage, disclaimer. All three,
every time, in full. See the template at the bottom.

## Structure

Chronology frames the month, so the arc leads; the reader needs to know the shape before the
details. Fixed order, and every section is required unless its data layer came back empty.

1. **Title and window.** "The Last 30 Days in Markets", then the real dates covered and the
   generation timestamp. The dates are the ones actually observed in the data, not the ones requested.

2. **The read, in four sentences or fewer.** Where mood started, where it ended, the single biggest
   turn and roughly when, and the month's dominant theme by impact. Write this section last, after
   the rest exists, or it becomes a preamble instead of a summary.

3. **The arc.** Walk the mood series: opening phase, closing phase, the largest single-day move and
   which component signals moved with it, and any phase-band crossing (Anxiety into Neutral,
   Optimism into Greed). Phase crossings are the part worth naming, because a 4-point move inside a
   band is noise and the same 4 points across a boundary is a regime change.

4. **What carried the month.** The top story clusters by `impactScore`, each as: date, cluster title
   verbatim, impact, sentiment, tickers. Eight to twelve is the right number. Group them into two or
   three themes if the tickers and titles genuinely cluster; leave them chronological if they do not.
   **A theme is an observation about the data, not a thesis you supply.**

5. **Names of the month.** Count ticker appearances across all distinct clusters (de-duplicated by `id`) and rank
   them, with each name's mean cluster sentiment beside its count. This is the most useful table in
   the brief and it costs no extra calls: it is derived entirely from data you already have.
   Say plainly that it counts *attention*, not performance. The story objects carry no sector
   field, so do not assign sectors to names from memory; if you add a sector line, take it from
   the mood response's `sectors` block and label it as the current reading, not the month's.

6. **Signals that fired.** From `insights/latest`, grouped by `insightType`: insider buying,
   institutional position changes, sentiment baseline deviations, volume anomalies. Report the
   type, the insight text and its `generatedAt` date. Note the preview cap here if `isPreview` is
   true.

7. **Where it stands today.** The current market summary headline and the current market-level
   insights, explicitly framed as *today's* read and not part of the retrospective. These are
   snapshot endpoints, so nothing here may carry a past-tense date claim. The summary headline
   and `expandedContent` are SentiSense-written prose that can quote the latest session's index or
   ETF moves and can name or link outlets: quote the headline as a snapshot dated by its
   `generatedAt`, keep its figures inside this section, and do not carry publisher names or links
   into the brief.

8. **What reports next.** The forward earnings window, compressed to a handful of names per day.
   Drop rows dated before today (New York time): the window starts on Monday, so those names have
   already reported. On the Free tier, when today's week has little left in it, add one
   `GET /api/v1/calendar/earnings?week=next` call and say which weeks the section covers. Note that
   dates are curated and that unconfirmed ones move.

9. **The closing block.** Fixed. See below.

**The inclusion bar for anything optional: would a reader who has been away for a month change what
they do next because of it?** A number they can get from any quote page fails. A regime change, a
theme they missed, an accumulation of insider buying in one name, a report landing Tuesday: those
pass.

---

## Voice

Write it as a desk note for someone competent who has been offline, not as a press roundup and not
as a research report with an agenda.

- **Lead with what changed.** A month is defined by its transitions. "Mood crossed from Anxiety into
  Optimism in the third week" is the sentence; the daily values are the support.
- **Numbers earn their place or they go.** Every figure in the brief should be one a reader could
  act on or argue with. Dumping the full 20-point series is a chart pretending to be prose.
- **No hedging stacks.** "May potentially indicate" is three hedges for one claim. Say what the data
  shows, then say what it does not cover. That is honest without being mushy.
- **Keep it to something a person reads in five minutes.** Roughly 600 to 900 words plus two tables.
  If it is longer, sections 4 and 6 have almost certainly grown past their usefulness.

---

## Freshness and what the numbers are

Say these where they apply rather than burying them all in a footnote.

- **Market Mood is a daily composite on weekdays**, computed from the latest analytical batch. It
  is not a real-time tick. No value exists for a weekend; a weekday market holiday can still carry
  one.
- **Story clusters are AI-generated groupings with AI-written titles.** `brokeAt` is when the story
  broke and `clusteredAt` is when it was clustered; they can differ by hours. Date by `brokeAt`
  with `clusteredAt` as the fallback, the same rule as the fetch step.
- **Sentiment on a cluster is an aggregate of the coverage in it**, not a price signal and not a
  forecast. It says how the discussion leaned, nothing more.
- **Insights are generated on a batch cadence**, so each insight's `generatedAt` (epoch **seconds**)
  is the honest as-of, not the moment you called.
- **The market summary carries its own age, in two units.** Its `generatedAt` is epoch **seconds**
  and its `lastUpdated` is epoch **milliseconds**; read the units or the age is off by a factor of
  a thousand. Date the "where it stands" section with `generatedAt`: `lastUpdated` is stamped with
  the time of your request, so it always reads as "just now".
- **Earnings dates are curated**, and unconfirmed ones move. A weekend earnings date is legitimate
  data for the handful of issuers that report that way; do not shift it to a weekday.

## The closing block

Reproduce all three parts, in this order, at the end of every brief. Fill the bracketed fields from
the data.

> **Coverage.** Market mood: [first date] to [last date], [N] daily readings. Story clusters: [N]
> clusters from [first date] to [last date]. Signals: [N] insights[, top 5 of [totalCount] on the free tier].
> Earnings: [window start] to [window end]. Snapshot sections reflect [timestamp], not the period.
>
> Built with SentiSense (https://sentisense.ai). Market data, AI-clustered market stories, sentiment
> and the Market Mood index via the SentiSense API.
>
> Not investment advice. Generated from public and licensed market data for research and educational
> purposes only. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any security, and it does not account for your
> circumstances, objectives or risk tolerance.

## Variants worth supporting

Same fan-out, different window or filter. Each is a small change, and none of them relaxes the
grounding rules above.

- **Last 7 or 14 days.** `filterHours=168` or `336`, `days=7` or `14` on mood. Fewer story pages,
  same paging rule.
- **One ticker's month.** Use the feed's ticker filter:
  `GET /api/v1/documents/stories?ticker={ticker}&filterHours=720&limit=20&offset=N`. With a
  ticker set, `limit` caps at 20 and the rows come newest first; page with `offset` until a page
  comes back short or empty, under the same paging rule as the market feed. That returns the
  clusters tagged with the name across the whole window in a few calls (for a heavily covered
  name, about three pages). Story search on the symbol is not a substitute: it returns at most
  50 rows, newest first, so for a busy name it covers only the latest part of the month, and the
  path form `GET /api/v1/documents/stories/ticker/{ticker}` takes `limit` only (default 5,
  capped 20) with no lookback window. If you already paged the market feed, filtering it to
  clusters whose `tickers` contain the symbol reaches the same set, at the cost of every page.
  Add `GET /api/v1/insights/stock/{ticker}` for the name's signals (Free returns the top 3 of
  `totalCount`; label it as a preview), and keep the market arc as the backdrop the name moved
  against.
- **One theme's month.** Pick the index from `GET /api/v1/indexes`, lead with its history, and filter
  the clusters to the tickers in that theme. Where the theme is a subject rather than a basket
  (`tariffs`, `fed decision`, `AI capex`), search it instead:
  `GET /api/v1/documents/stories/search?query=tariffs&days=30`.
- **A weekly cadence.** Run it every Friday with `filterHours=168` and keep the same structure, so
  consecutive briefs are comparable.
