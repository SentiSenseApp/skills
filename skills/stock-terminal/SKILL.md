# Stock Terminal - SentiSense

> Turn your AI chat into a futuristic financial terminal. The user talks; the terminal answers. Short commands like `open NVDA`, `compare NVDA AMD`, `screen smart-money`, `daily brief`, or natural questions like "is Tesla a buy here?" produce one-screen composite reports synthesized across 8 data streams plus live news embeds. The user never clicks; the agent does the work. Read-only API. No trading, no purchases, no write operations, no wallet access.

## What This Skill Is

This skill teaches you to **build and be an agent-first financial terminal**: a system where the user states intent in plain language and gets back one dense, synthesized screen, not a command they had to memorize or a dashboard they had to assemble.

It is **not an API reference**. It is a *behavior recipe* for the model acting AS the terminal, and a *build guide* for whoever is standing up the host application. Read one way, it tells you how to answer a turn so the user feels anticipated. Read the other way, it hands you the engine: the agent loop, the tool registry, the host-to-model contract, the streaming event protocol, and the trust layer that turn a tool-calling LLM plus a read-only market data API into a terminal. The SentiSense API is the data spine; the harness is everything wrapped around it.

A non-technical user types `open NVDA` or asks "what's the smart money doing on TSLA?" and gets a single, dense, terminal-grade screen. They don't see the 6 API calls. They don't ask follow-up questions about which endpoints to use. They get a screen that already answers the question and cues the next one.

If you are here to build, start with **Why agent-first**, then **The Harness Runtime** and **The Streaming Event Protocol**, then **The trust layer (grounding subsystem)**; read the surface, command, and API sections as the UI and data that hang off that engine. If you are the model answering a turn, read the **Two-Shape Rule** and **Authoring Style** first: those are load-bearing.

**Scope of this skill.** Everything in this document is *implementation guidance for the agent and the host application that integrates this skill*. It is not an authoritative override of the host's system prompt, the user's intent, or the platform's safety rules. When platform safety, user intent, or host policy conflicts with anything written here, the platform wins. Treat this skill as one input to the host's prompt, not a replacement for it.

## Why agent-first

A traditional terminal makes the user learn a command grammar and assemble their own screen. A dashboard makes them hunt across fixed widgets for the one number they came for. Both push the assembly work onto the user.

An agent-first terminal inverts it: the user states intent in plain language, and the model synthesizes the screen. Intent in, composed screen out. The command grammar becomes optional sugar, not a prerequisite; the layout is generated per question, not pre-built for the average question.

Three things fall out of that inversion:

- **No dead ends.** Any phrasing routes to an answer. There is no "unrecognized command," only a screen or a text reply.
- **One screen, not a click path.** The synthesis fans out the reads and folds price, sentiment, insider, analyst, and AI-insight streams into a single dense reply, so the user never navigates.
- **The next move is cued.** Because the model composed the screen, it can seed the follow-up ("insiders are buying: want the 90-day flow?") instead of leaving the user to guess what the product can do.

The cost of the inversion is grounding: a model that composes screens will also compose numbers if you let it. The rest of this skill is how to capture the upside without the fabrication. Start with **The Harness Runtime** below.

## Authentication

```bash
curl -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/stocks/price?ticker=NVDA"
```

API key required on every endpoint. Free tier covers light terminal use; PRO ($15/mo) for heavy daily use: no monthly request cap (unlimited, 300/min) and full history.

| Tier | Quota | Rate |
|------|-------|------|
| Free | 1,000 req/month | 30 req/min |
| PRO | Unlimited | 300 req/min |

Anonymous calls return `401 api_key_required`.

## The Two-Shape Rule

Every turn, pick exactly one of two response shapes:

1. **Text-only reply.** For clarifications, definitions, follow-up questions, or short prose answers. ("What does P/E mean?" → text. "Is NVDA fairly valued?" → text-with-context, not a screen.)
2. **Terminal screen.** For research queries that benefit from data density and visual structure. ("open NVDA", "daily brief", "what's hot today?" → terminal screen.)

If the user's ask reads better as prose, reply in text. If they're asking to see data, produce a screen. When in doubt, go terminal. Never produce both: pick one shape and commit.

Never say "let me look that up" or "one moment, fetching data..." or "I'll need to call several endpoints." The terminal does the work silently and presents the answer.

---

## The Harness Runtime (agent loop)

A terminal is not a prompt; it is a loop. Everything else in this document (the Two-Shape Rule, the surfaces, the tool ladder, the chips) hangs off one runtime that the host application owns. This section is the engine. It is provider-agnostic (any tool-calling LLM) and renderer-agnostic (any UI stack).

### The system-prompt scaffold

The host application owns the system prompt; this skill is one input to it (see Scope of this skill). At minimum the host prompt must establish:

- **Identity.** "You are a read-only financial terminal. The user talks; you answer with dense, synthesized screens."
- **The Two-Shape Rule.** Reply in text, or render one terminal screen. Never both.
- **A grounding requirement.** Never quote a price, percent, rating, headline, or date from memory. Call a tool first. If a tool errors or returns empty, say so; do not fill the gap with a guess. This is the load-bearing directive: see **The trust layer (grounding subsystem)** for why it must live in your prompt, not just here.
- **Formatting law.** Tickers as `$NVDA`. Prices two decimals. Signed percents. Sentiment as a [-1, 1] polarity, never a 0-100 score. (See Authoring Style.)
- **The no-advice frame.** Data and educational context only, never a personal buy/sell recommendation.
- **The tool list.** Name each available tool and its one-line contract so the model knows its reach (the registry below).

Keep it declarative: the prompt sets the laws, the tools do the work, the loop enforces the turn.

### The loop

Each user turn runs the same cycle: **intent -> plan -> parallel tool calls -> synthesize -> render**. The model does the planning and synthesis; the host owns everything around it (assembling input, running tool handlers, streaming events to the UI, persisting state).

```
async function runTurn(userText, session, emit):
    # 1. Host assembles model input. The model never sees the API key.
    preamble = buildSurfacePreamble(session.surface)      # see host<->model contract
    tools    = session.registry.exposedFor(session.surface) # schemas only, no handlers
    messages = session.thread + [{ role:"user",
                                   content: preamble + "\n\n" + userText }]

    emit({ type:"turn_start", turnId })

    # 2. Tool loop: model may call tools, host feeds results back, repeat
    #    until the model stops requesting tools (a final answer).
    loop:
        stream = model.stream(messages, tools)
        assistantMsg = ""
        for delta in stream:
            if delta.text:
                assistantMsg += delta.text
                emit({ type:"text_delta", turnId, text: delta.text })
            if delta.tool_call:
                emit({ type:"tool_call", turnId, id: delta.tool_call.id,
                       name: delta.tool_call.name,
                       argSummary: humanLabel(delta.tool_call.args),
                       status:"pending" })

        if stream.tool_calls is empty:
            break                                    # model produced the answer

        # PARALLEL. Independent calls never await each other (Synthesis Rule 9).
        results = await allSettled(stream.tool_calls.map(runToolHandler))
        for r in results:
            emit({ type:"tool_result", turnId, id: r.id,
                   status: r.ok ? "ok" : "error" })
        messages += toolResultMessages(results)       # ok OR error, both go back

    # 3. Settle. If the answer is a Two-Shape 'terminal screen', emit it as an artifact.
    if isArtifact(assistantMsg):
        emit({ type:"artifact", turnId, artifactId, kind, body: assistantMsg })
    emit({ type:"turn_end", turnId })

    session.thread = messages                          # persist for the next turn
```

Three properties make this feel like a terminal rather than a chatbot:

- **Parallel fan-out.** When a screen needs price plus sentiment plus insider plus analyst, the model requests all four tools in one step and the host runs them with `allSettled`. Never serialize independent calls. This is Synthesis Rule 9 made concrete.
- **Errors go back into the loop, not to the user.** A failed handler returns a structured error result the model can reason about ("no current sentiment reading for $X") instead of throwing. This is what lets the agent silently degrade (Authoring Style: no apologies) instead of dead-ending.
- **The loop terminates on a text-only step.** The model signals "done" by producing a turn with no tool calls. Cap the iterations (a small bound, e.g. 6) so a misbehaving plan cannot spin.

### The tool registry

A tool is four parts. The model sees the first three; the host keeps the fourth private.

```
{
  name:        "get_quote",                 # stable identifier, shown in chips
  description: "Live price + day change for one ticker.",
  input:       { ticker: "string, e.g. NVDA" },   # JSON Schema the model fills in
  handler:     async ({ticker}) => callApi(...)     # host-only; injects the key
}
```

The registry is the single source of truth for what the model can do. It maps one-to-one onto the cost-ordered tool ladder in **Grounding the agent (tool ladder)**; build exactly these and nothing the model can call that you have not wrapped:

| Tool | Ladder rung | Wraps (endpoint) |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `read_screen({ target })` | 1 (free) | nothing; reads the local snapshot cache |
| `get_quote(ticker)` | 2 (live) | `GET /api/v1/stocks/price?ticker={T}` |
| `get_chart_summary(ticker, timeframe)` | 2 (live) | `GET /api/v1/stocks/chart?ticker={T}&timeframe=1M` |
| `get_metrics(ticker)` | 2 (live) | `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{T}/metric/sentiment` |
| `get_ai_summary(ticker, depth)` | 3 (pre-computed) | `GET /api/v1/stocks/{T}/ai-summary?depth=basic\|deep` |
| `get_insights(ticker)` | 3 (pre-computed) | `GET /api/v1/insights/stock/{T}` |
| `search_documents(query)` | 4 (topical) | `GET /api/v1/documents/search` |

Handler rules, non-negotiable:

- **The handler injects `X-SentiSense-API-Key`, not the model.** The key lives in host process state (`SENTISENSE_API_KEY`), is read inside the handler, and never enters the message history, a tool argument, or an emitted event. A model that cannot see the key cannot leak it.
- **The handler normalizes the response before returning it.** Do the wrap-vs-flat unwrapping, the `metricValue.value.value` extraction, and the epoch-seconds-vs-ms fixes (see **API shape gotchas**) inside the handler so the model reasons over clean values, not raw envelopes.
- **Every handler must hit the API (or the `read_screen` cache), never training memory.** This is what keeps extensibility from reintroducing the stale-number failure the ladder exists to prevent.
- **The registry filters by surface.** `exposedFor(surface)` returns only the tools that make sense where the user is: a ticker dashboard exposes `read_screen('dashboard')`; a cold omnibox thread with no active ticker does not. Narrowing the toolset per surface is how you stop the model from calling `read_screen` when there is no screen.

### The host-to-model contract

Each turn, the host injects three things and the model returns two. Nothing else crosses the boundary.

```
HOST INJECTS                         MODEL RETURNS
-----------------------------        ----------------------------
1. surface preamble  (context)       a. text deltas   (the reply)
2. exposed tool schemas (registry)   b. tool calls    (name + args)
3. thread history    (memory)
```

The **surface preamble** is a short bracketed line the host prepends to the user message at runtime (detailed in **Building a multi-surface terminal**). It tells the model where the user is, what is already on screen, and the preferred response shape:

```
[Surface: ticker-dashboard. Active ticker: $NVDA. Visible widgets: price chart,
metrics, news, peers. Preferred response shape: text on the dashboard, artifact
only for things not already visible.]
```

This preamble is host-emitted runtime context, not skill-authored content, and it is what lets the model resolve "it" / "this company" to the active ticker and pick a shape instead of guessing. One hard boundary: this skill is one input to your host prompt, never a replacement for it. Grounding requirements ("call `read_screen('dashboard')` before quoting a number") live in your host system prompt; the skill describes the pattern but cannot enforce it.

### Session and context state (what persists vs resets)

The terminal feels alive because the thread has memory, and it feels haunted when the wrong state carries across a context change. Be deliberate about scope:

| State | Scope | Lifecycle |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Thread messages | Per thread | Persist across turns; this is the conversation |
| `tickerContext` (active symbol) | Per thread | Persist until the user changes ticker |
| `read_screen` snapshot cache | Per surface | Reset on context change; see **The trust layer** |
| Current-artifact + source-mix-expansion selection | Per surface | Reset on context change (State hygiene) |
| `institutional/quarters` -> `latestQuarter` | Per session | Cache for the session; rarely changes (Synthesis Rule 10) |
| Resolved headline titles | Per session | Cache 30 min keyed by URL (Headline Resolution) |
| `SENTISENSE_API_KEY` | Host process only | Never enters thread, model context, or events |

The rule of thumb: **continuity of the chat thread is a feature; continuity of UI selection across contexts is a bug.** When the active ticker changes, keep the thread, drop the snapshot cache and the selection state, and let the new context start clean. The write-through snapshot cache that `read_screen` reads (rung 1) is specified in full under **The trust layer (grounding subsystem)**; leaking a prior ticker's snapshot into a new dashboard is how the agent quotes the wrong stock's numbers with full confidence.

### Keep the engine portable

Keep four layers separable: the loop, the commands, the tools, and the theme. **The model is a socket, not a dependency:** the loop asks only for a tool-calling contract (given tool schemas, emit a `{ name, arguments }` call, read back a JSON result, continue), so it names no provider; one small adapter per provider translates that provider's native tool-call envelope to and from this neutral shape, and swapping models touches nothing else. **A command is data, not code:** each command is a row (a match pattern, an ordered call list, an output template) the loop reads and synthesizes, so adding `sector`, `watchlist`, or your own screener is appending a row, not branching the loop; a new tool registers the same way (register `{ name, description, input, handler }` and the executor iterates the table). Because hosts install a skill once and rarely refresh it, prefer changes that live in your executor and registry (server-side, invisible to installed copies) over changes that force every host to re-pull this file; reserve a version bump for genuine contract changes: a new command grammar, a new tool the model must know exists, or a corrected field mapping.

---

## The Streaming Event Protocol

The loop above communicates with the UI over a single ordered event stream (SSE, a WebSocket, or an async generator; the shape is the same). Six event types carry everything the UI needs. Each event is a small JSON object with a `type` and a `turnId`; the UI is a reducer over the stream.

```
{ "type":"turn_start",  "turnId":"t_42" }
{ "type":"text_delta",  "turnId":"t_42", "text":"$NVDA " }
{ "type":"tool_call",   "turnId":"t_42", "id":"c_1", "name":"get_quote",
                        "argSummary":"$NVDA", "status":"pending" }
{ "type":"tool_result", "turnId":"t_42", "id":"c_1", "status":"ok" }
{ "type":"artifact",    "turnId":"t_42", "artifactId":"a_7", "kind":"compare",
                        "body":"<markdown or structured artifact document>" }
{ "type":"turn_end",    "turnId":"t_42" }
```

| Event | UI effect | Maps to |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `turn_start` | Open a fresh assistant message bubble | (loop bookkeeping) |
| `text_delta` | Append tokens to the bubble as they arrive | Stream text deltas (Transparency UX) |
| `tool_call` | Render / update a tool-call chip | Tool-call chips (Transparency UX) |
| `tool_result` | Flip the matching chip to done or failed | Tool-call chips (Transparency UX) |
| `artifact` | Open a slide-over over the dashboard column | Slide-over for AI artifacts (multi-surface) |
| `turn_end` | Settle the message; stop the typing indicator | (loop bookkeeping) |

How the pieces connect to the UX the doc already specifies:

- **Chips are `tool_call` / `tool_result` events, keyed by `id`.** Emit `tool_call` with `status:"pending"` the instant the model requests the tool (muted gray `…`), then emit `tool_result` with `status:"ok"` (accent-blue `✓`) or `"error"` (red `!`) when the handler settles. The chip is `<icon> name(argSummary)`; the UI matches result to call by `id`. Stream them **as they fire**, interleaved with `text_delta`, so the turn reads chips-appear -> tokens-flow -> settle, not a batch dump at the end.
- **`argSummary` is a 1-to-3-word human label, never raw args.** Send `"$NVDA"`, `"dashboard"`, `"story 1a2b"`, not the full argument object and never anything derived from the API key. The event stream reaches the client; treat it as untrusted for secrets. Keep full args (for the hover-to-inspect affordance) host-side, resolved by `id` on demand.
- **`artifact` is how the Two-Shape 'terminal screen' becomes a slide-over.** When the model's answer is a cross-ticker comparison, a custom thesis card, or anything not already on the dashboard, the host emits one `artifact` event; the UI opens it as a slide-over covering the dashboard column while keeping the chat visible, and drops an artifact chip in history to re-open it. A text-only answer emits only `text_delta` events and no `artifact`. That is the Two-Shape Rule expressed on the wire: exactly one of {text, artifact} per turn.
- **`kind` lets the UI pick a renderer.** Values like `compare`, `thesis`, `screen`, `watchlist` map to your artifact templates.

One turn, one `turnId`, one bubble: every event a turn emits carries the same `turnId`, so a client that reconnects mid-stream can discard a half-rendered turn and wait for the next `turn_start` cleanly. This protocol is the contract between the loop and any renderer; keep the six types stable and you can swap the entire UI without touching the engine.

### The artifact body: a structured, validated document

An `artifact` event's `body` can be markdown (simplest) or, for a native canvas, a **structured artifact document**: an ordered list of typed blocks the host validates and maps to native components. The monospace box and the markdown table in the `open` command are the two lowest-fidelity renderers of that same block list; native components are the third, richest one. The model **proposes structure**; the host **owns rendering**. That split keeps the canvas safe (no arbitrary markup from the model), consistent (one component set), and re-renderable (the same artifact can redraw on theme change, resize, or re-open).

Envelope plus an ordered `blocks[]`, host-agnostic:

```json
{
  "id": "art_nvda_1a2b", "version": 1, "surface": "dashboard",
  "title": "$NVDA screen", "tickerContext": "NVDA",
  "sourceTools": ["read_screen", "get_ai_summary"],
  "blocks": [
    { "type": "header", "ticker": "NVDA", "name": "NVIDIA Corp",
      "sector": "Technology", "price": 190.20, "changePct": 1.23 },
    { "type": "stat-grid", "items": [
      { "label": "Sentiment", "value": "+0.42", "sub": "+0.08 30d",
        "tone": "bull", "format": "polarity" } ] },
    { "type": "chart", "ticker": "NVDA", "timeframe": "1M",
      "kind": "price", "seriesRef": "chart:NVDA:1M" },
    { "type": "thesis-card", "stance": "mixed", "title": "AI insight",
      "body": "Margin guide raised, services beating consensus.",
      "generatedAt": 1719700000 }
  ]
}
```

`id`/`version` make the artifact addressable: history chips re-open a snapshot by `id`, and "refresh this" mints a new `id` and bumps `version` rather than mutating in place. `surface` (`dashboard` or `slide-over`) reuses the two-surface model in **Building a multi-surface terminal**; the default-to-text rule still holds, so do not emit a slide-over that only re-renders blocks already on the dashboard.

Six block types cover the terminal:

| `type` | Renders as | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `header` | Ticker title bar | `ticker`, `name`, `sector`, `price`, `changePct` |
| `stat-grid` | Row-per-metric panel | `items[]: { label, value, sub?, tone, format? }` |
| `chart` | Price/metric chart | `ticker`, `timeframe`, `kind`, `seriesRef` |
| `table` | Aligned grid | `columns[]`, `align[]`, `rows[][]` |
| `news-list` | Sentiment-tagged feed | `items[]: { sentiment, headline, source, published, url }` |
| `thesis-card` | One-line synthesis | `stance`, `title`, `body`, `generatedAt`, `footnote?` |

**Validate then render (the gate is load-bearing).** The model is not trusted to name components:

- Whitelist `block.type`; drop unknown types silently, never render them raw. Coerce `tone` to `bull | bear | neutral`; anything else becomes `neutral`.
- Never accept a raw HTML, script, style, or URL-scheme field from the model. The only markup that reaches the DOM is what your components emit. The oEmbed `html` block for a social embed is an exception because it is host-fetched, not model-authored (see **Social Embeds**).
- Clamp array lengths (`news-list` to the feed limit, `table.rows` to a sane cap) so a runaway generation cannot blow up the layout.
- If the document is malformed, fall back to the markdown `open` template rather than showing a broken screen. Never crash the turn.

Field rules that keep the canvas honest and match the API shapes:

- `header.price` is the `stocks/price` response's `currentPrice` (flat, at root, no `price` wrapper); `header.changePct` is its `changePercent`; `header.name` is `profile.name` (not `companyName`).
- `stat-grid.items[].format` is `polarity | price | percent | count`. Use `polarity` for the Sentiment value (a float in [-1, 1]; render the sign unmistakably, never a 0-100 scale). Report the separate SentiSense Score as-is: unbounded, never normalized. `tone` drives the accent color, not the sign of the number.
- `chart.timeframe` is one of `1D / 5D / 1W / 1M / 3M / 6M / 1Y / ALL`. `seriesRef` points at the same local snapshot cache `read_screen` reads; the host resolves it to points and reads the x-axis from each point's `timestamp` (Unix ms), never the pre-formatted `date` string.
- `news-list.items[].headline` is resolved by you via the **Headline Resolution** pattern (the document API returns no title). `sentiment` is the document's `averageSentiment` (scalar in [-1, 1]); `published` is epoch seconds.
- `thesis-card.body` is `insights[0].insightText` or the `ai-summary` text (there is no `headline` field on insights). Because sentiment, insights, and AI summaries are batch metrics, always carry `generatedAt` so the card can show freshness. Never claim "real time" on a thesis card.

---

## Building a multi-surface terminal

Before you write a screen, decide the layout. The terminal experience that feels right uses two surfaces, no more:

1. **Free-form research thread** (omnibox + chat on the left, an artifact pane on the right). Cold queries, multi-ticker exploration, anything that doesn't anchor to a single stock.
2. **Ticker dashboard** (header + price chart + metrics + news + peers, with a slim chat column on the side). The user is reading one stock; the AI is grounded to that stock.

Don't propose a third column. Don't merge the two surfaces into one mega-page.

**Anchor chats to context.** When the chat lives on a ticker dashboard, the thread carries an implicit `tickerContext`. Resolve "the stock", "it", "this company" to that ticker without asking. Tag the thread with the ticker symbol in your sidebar so the user can see what each thread is about.

**Slide-over for AI artifacts on the dashboard.** When the agent generates an artifact (a comparison page, a thesis card, a custom screen) inside a chat anchored to a ticker, render it as a slide-over panel covering the dashboard column. Keep the chat column visible so the user can keep talking. Click an artifact chip in chat history to re-open it. Don't shove a third column on screen just to fit the artifact.

**Surface preamble pattern.** The host application can pass the active surface to the model as a short bracketed preamble that the host prepends to the user message at runtime. Example of the runtime payload your app might build (this is host-emitted context, not skill-authored content):

```
[Surface: ticker-dashboard. Active ticker: $NVDA. Visible widgets: price chart,
metrics, news, peers. Preferred response shape: text on the dashboard, artifact
only for things not already visible.]

is NVDA still mooning?
```

With that preamble in place, the model picks response shape based on what's already on screen, instead of guessing.

**Default to text on the dashboard.** The dashboard already shows price, sentiment, news, peers. An artifact that re-renders any of those is duplication. Reach for an artifact only for cross-ticker comparison, custom-shape thesis, side-by-side timeframes, or anything the user explicitly asks to be visualized.

**State hygiene on context change.** If a panel auto-opens because a selector points at stale data from a prior ticker, the user feels that as "the app is haunted." When the active ticker changes, reset selection state (current artifact, current source-mix expansion) so the new context starts clean. Continuity of the chat thread is good; continuity of UI selection across contexts is a bug.

---

## The omnibox entry surface

Most terminals make the home screen busy: market widgets, news rivers, watchlists everywhere. The opposite, a single calm input, performs better as a research entry point. The user shows up wanting to ask something; meet that intent directly.

Layout:

```

Components:

- **A single centered input**, ~600 to 800px wide, large placeholder text. No buttons, no decorative chrome.
- **Inline ticker autosuggest** that opens as the user types. Rank order: exact symbol match → symbol prefix → name prefix → name contains. Show ticker + company name + a small logo per row.
- **A scrolling ticker tape ribbon** at the bottom of the home view, ~40px tall. Cycles ~20 popular tickers leftward. Hover pauses scroll. Click navigates to that ticker's dashboard.
- **No widgets, no quote panels, no news on home.** Save those for the ticker dashboard. The home is "what do you want to research?" not "here's everything we have."

Submission behavior:

- Free-form question (no recognized symbol) → opens a thread, model answers in chat.
- A bare ticker symbol or `$X` token → routes directly to the ticker dashboard, skips the chat round trip.
- Selecting an autosuggest row → ticker dashboard.

Why this works: an empty-but-elegant home stays inviting. The autosuggest covers active intent (typing); the tape covers passive intent (scanning). Together they make the cold-start feel light, not overwhelming.

## Metrics panel pattern

The cleanest way to show batch metrics (SentiSense Score, Sentiment, Mentions, Social Dominance, anything similar) on a stock dashboard is a row-per-metric panel with a mini skyline bar and a lazy-loaded source breakdown.

Per-metric row:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SentiSense Score                                    │
│ Sentiment × mentions          +0.65  ▮▯▮▮▯▮▯  ⌄    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Components:

- **Title + 1-line description** on the left, terse. The title is the metric name as the user sees it ("SentiSense Score", not `sentisense_score`).
- **Headline value** on the right. Format depends on the metric: signed for [-1, 1] scores (`+0.65`), compact for counts (`12.4K`), percent for shares (`3.42%`). Color the value: green when positive (or above neutral), red when negative, neutral gray when null.
- **Mini skyline bar** between value and chevron: 7 vertical bars of the last 7 readings, each green or red per direction, ~14-16px tall and ~56px wide. Bars anchor at the bottom and scale to the max-absolute value in the window. This signals trend at a glance without taking chart real estate.
- **Chevron** on the rightmost edge, only for metrics that have a source breakdown. Tap to expand; fetch the breakdown lazily on first expand.

Expanded breakdown:

- "Source mix" header in small caps.
- One row per source with name, share percentage, and a thin progress bar (capped at 100%).
- Sort by share descending so the dominant source reads first.

Why this works:

- Multiple metrics fit comfortably in a narrow column on the dashboard.
- The skyline encodes recent trend without claiming chart space (which the price chart already owns).
- Lazy-loading the breakdown saves an API call per metric on the cold dashboard load. Most users never expand it; those who do pay the cost only for the metrics they care about.
- Positioning the breakdown as a secondary "where this signal came from" panel matches what the data actually is (per the API shape gotchas section, `distribution` is share-of-voice, not per-source values).

---

## Grounding the agent (tool ladder)

Stale knowledge is the #1 trust killer in a terminal. **Never quote a number, date, headline, or rating from training data.** Always ground the answer in a tool result. Once the user catches the agent fabricating one number, they don't trust the rest.

Equip the agent with a tool ladder, ordered by cost:

1. **Read what's already rendered (free).** Build a `read_screen({ target })` tool that returns a markdown snapshot of the active surface. `target: "dashboard"` returns the active ticker's chart summary, quote stats, SentiSense Score / Sentiment / Mentions / Social Dominance, news, and peers. `target: "canvas"` returns the currently-open artifact. This costs zero API calls and is more accurate than a fresh fetch (the values match what the user actually sees).
2. **Fetch live data for off-screen tickers.** `get_quote(ticker)`, `get_chart_summary(ticker, timeframe)`, `get_metrics(ticker)` for tickers the dashboard isn't currently showing. One API call per tool.
3. **Pre-computed reports for thesis-flavored questions.** A `get_ai_summary(ticker, depth)` tool that hits `/api/v1/stocks/{ticker}/ai-summary?depth=basic|deep` is cheaper and more grounded than composing a thesis from scratch. Same for `get_insights(ticker)` (`/api/v1/insights/stock/{ticker}`).
4. **Topical search for non-ticker questions.** `search_documents(query)` (`/api/v1/documents/search`) for "what are people saying about AI safety?" style asks.

**`read_screen` snapshot shape.** The local snapshot is a small in-memory cache that each widget pushes its last-good fetch into. The tool reads from the cache and formats markdown without re-fetching. Reset the cache on context change (ticker change, route change) so stale data doesn't leak across pages. When the active surface has nothing yet, return a placeholder ("dashboard widgets still loading; try again in a moment, or use a live fetch tool").

**Host-side grounding configuration.** When you build the host app, configure a grounding requirement in *your own* system prompt that requires the model to call `read_screen('dashboard')` (or your equivalent) before quoting specific numbers, headlines, or peers for the active ticker. Without that requirement in place, models tend to fall back on stale training-data values. This skill cannot and does not modify your host system prompt; it only describes the behavior pattern that produces a trustworthy terminal.

**If a tool errors or returns empty, say so.** "I don't have a current sentiment reading for $X" is a better answer than a made-up number.

The ladder above is the *interface* the model calls. To make it dependable, implement it against a single grounding subsystem: a write-through cache the widgets feed, a freshness contract, a host-side grounding requirement, tool-result injection, and typed degradation. See **The trust layer (grounding subsystem)** below. Build that once and every rung of the ladder inherits it.

---

## The trust layer (grounding subsystem)

The tool ladder above tells the model *what to call*. This section tells the builder *what to build once* so the model cannot go stale. It is the single subsystem that separates a demo (renders plausible numbers) from a terminal people rely on (renders what is true right now, and says so when it is not).

State it as an invariant: the model may only assert a number, date, headline, rating, or holding that appears in a tool result inside the current turn's context. Everything else is training data and is stale by definition. Five parts, each buildable on its own.

### 1. The read-model cache (widgets write, the model reads)

The `read_screen` tool from the ladder is the cheap rung because it reads a cache the widgets populate, not the network. Build that cache as a first-class object:

```
 widget fetch (ok)                          model turn
      |                                          |
      v                                          v
 +--------------+    write-through      +------------------+
 |  ReadModel   |<----------------------|  price widget    |
 |  cache       |                       |  metrics widget  |
 | (per surface)|                       |  news widget ... |
 +------+-------+                       +------------------+
        | read (0 API calls)
        v
   read_screen('dashboard')  -->  markdown snapshot  -->  model context
```

Every widget, on a successful fetch, writes its normalized result into a per-surface cache *before* it renders. `read_screen` reads that cache and formats markdown; it never re-fetches. The value the model quotes is therefore the exact value on the user's screen: cheaper (zero API calls) and more trustworthy (no drift between what the user sees and what the model says).

Cache entry schema (one per surface and slot):

```
CacheEntry {
  key:       "dashboard:$NVDA:metrics"   // surface : ticker : slot
  status:    "ok" | "empty" | "error" | "preview"
  kind:      "realtime" | "batch"
  value:     <normalized payload>         // already unwrapped per the API gotchas
  fetchedAt: 1719772800000                // when the widget called the API (epoch ms)
  dataAsOf:  1719759600000 | null         // batch generatedAt; null for realtime
}
```

Two hard rules on the cache:

- Store the *normalized* value, not the raw envelope. Unwrap `{ isPreview, data }` and pull `metricValue.value.value` at write time (see API shape gotchas) so the model never re-derives a shape, and never re-introduces a shape bug it cannot see.
- Reset the whole cache on context change (ticker change, route change). A stale `$AMD` metrics entry surviving into a `$NVDA` dashboard is the haunted-app failure from the multi-surface section, in data form.

When a slot has nothing yet, `read_screen` returns the loading placeholder (already specified in the ladder), not an omission. An absent row reads as "zero"; a labeled "loading" row reads as "not yet."

### 2. The freshness contract

Grounding is not only "is it fetched" but "how old is fetched allowed to be." Bind every surface to one of two freshness classes and render each class differently. This is the enforcement layer for the batch-vs-real-time gotcha; it does not change which endpoints are which.

| Class | Surfaces | Cache `kind` | How the model renders it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real-time | quote, price, chart points | `realtime` | State the value plainly. Re-fetch on the poll interval, never faster than ~60s on the header. |
| Batch | Sentiment, SentiSense Score, Mentions, Social Dominance, news clustering, AI summary, insights | `batch` | State the value, then annotate freshness: `as of {dataAsOf}`. Never call it "real time." |

The `dataAsOf` for a batch slot is the payload's `generatedAt` (present on insight and AI-summary surfaces). Surfacing it is not decoration: it is what lets a user trust a `+0.42` sentiment reading taken at the open even though price has moved since. A batch value with no visible age is indistinguishable from a fabricated one.

Compose-time rule the model applies: if two values on one screen have different freshness classes and the question is time-sensitive ("is it still mooning?"), lead with the real-time value and tag the batch value's age, rather than blending both into one implied "now."

### 3. The grounding requirement (host prompt, not this skill)

The cache and the contract are inert unless the host's own system prompt forces the model to consult them. This skill cannot edit your system prompt; you wire this once, on your side. A directive block that holds up:

```
Before you state any number, date, headline, rating, or holding for the
active ticker, call read_screen('dashboard') and read the value from its
result. If the value you need is not in that result, call the matching live
fetch tool. Never answer these from prior knowledge. If a tool returns
empty or errors, say you don't have that reading; do not estimate it.
```

Keep it in the host prompt because it must outrank the model's default helpfulness, which is to answer immediately from memory. Skill text is one input to the prompt; the grounding requirement has to be host-owned to be load-bearing.

### 4. Tool-result to context injection

Fetching is half the loop. The model only stays grounded if each result is injected back into its context as a first-class message it must read, not paraphrased away. The shape that keeps it honest:

```
loop each turn:
  model emits tool_call(s)             // e.g. get_metrics($NVDA)
  host executes, normalizes, caches    // write-through, per part 1
  host appends a tool_result message:
     +-----------------------------------------------+
     | tool: get_metrics($NVDA)                      |
     | status: ok   kind: batch   dataAsOf: 09:31 ET |
     | value: { sentiment: +0.42, score: 1830, ... } |
     +-----------------------------------------------+
  model reads tool_result, composes screen from it
```

Two builder rules that keep injection trustworthy:

- Inject the same normalized value you cached and rendered, with the freshness header attached. The model, the cache, and the pixels then agree by construction.
- Never let the model carry a prior turn's numbers forward from memory. On a follow-up ("and the day before?"), it must call again; one extra fetch costs less than one confidently wrong number, the exact asymmetry the anti-patterns section already names.

### 5. Graceful degradation (empty / error / preview)

A terminal earns trust as much from how it fails as from how it renders. Map every non-`ok` cache status to an explicit render: never a blank cell, never a fabricated fill.

| Status | Cause | Model renders |
|---|---|---|
| `empty` | Valid call, empty array (e.g. the 7-day insider/congress lag, `isPreview:false`) | Say the window is empty and widen it (`lookbackDays=30`), noting the wider window in the header. Not an error, not a zero. |
| `error` | Non-2xx, timeout, `401 api_key_required`, `429` | "I don't have a current {metric} for $X." On `429`, surface the `Retry-After` hint ("rate limit reached, retrying in N s"); do not silently serve a stale value. |
| `preview` | Free-tier `isPreview:true` (top-3 insights, current-week earnings, sliced flow) | Render the preview slice as the answer; tag `(preview)` in a corner. Mention PRO only if the truncation is materially limiting the answer. |

The through-line: degrade to *less data*, never to *invented data*. An honest "I don't have that reading" costs one moment of friction; a fabricated number costs the whole session's trust, and the user cannot tell the two apart at read time. That asymmetry is the entire reason the trust layer exists.

---

## Transparency UX (tool-call chips)

The terminal feels more trustworthy when the user can see what the agent is doing. Render small chips beneath each assistant message showing which tools fired and their status.

Format each chip as `<icon> tool_name(arg-summary)` where:

- `icon` is `…` while pending, `✓` on success, `!` on failure.
- `tool_name` is the tool's identifier (e.g. `get_quote`, `read_screen`).
- `arg-summary` is a 1 to 3 word human label (e.g. `$NVDA`, `dashboard`, `story 1a2b…`).

Stream chips into the message **as they fire**, not at the end of the turn. The user sees real lookups happening rather than just a dots animation. Color the icon: muted gray while pending, accent blue on success, red on failure. Hover should show the full tool call (name + full args + status).

Chips build trust **and** give the user an implicit cost model. More chips means more API calls. Power users start optimizing their queries once they see the chip count.

**Stream text deltas too.** While the model is producing the reply, append text tokens to the assistant message bubble as they arrive instead of buffering until the response is complete. Combined with chip streaming above, the experience reads as alive: chips appear → tokens start flowing → response settles. Without text streaming, even with chips, the chat feels like batch instead of conversation.

---

## Visual defaults (palette, type, motion)

The skill is renderer-agnostic, but a terminal that doesn't pick deliberate visual defaults will land on whatever its UI library suggests, which is usually generic Bootstrap blue and gray. Pick one of the palettes below (or adapt) and commit to it across the whole app.

### Three palettes that work

**Charcoal (calm, modern):**

```
bg          #1C1C1E
surface     #2C2C2E
text        #F5F5F7
muted       #8E8E93
accent      #0A84FF
bull        #30D158
bear        #FF453A
```

**Slate (technical, neutral):**

```
bg          #0F172A   (slate-900)
surface     #1E293B   (slate-800)
text        #F1F5F9   (slate-100)
muted       #64748B   (slate-500)
accent      #38BDF8   (sky-400)
bull        #22C55E   (green-500)
bear        #EF4444   (red-500)
```

**Cocoa (warm dark, premium):**

```
bg          #1A1612
surface     #2A231D
text        #F0E9E0
muted       #7A6B5D
accent      #D4A843   (gold)
bull        #A8C97A
bear        #C97070
```

All three are dark-default. Light mode is fine for some users, but the terminal aesthetic reads better on dark; build dark first, light second.

### Shared rules across palettes

- **Type.** Sans-serif for prose (Inter, system-ui). Monospace for tickers and tabular data (`SF Mono`, `JetBrains Mono`, `Fira Code`). Don't mix three families; sans + mono is enough.
- **Numerals.** Always tabular: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`. Columns of numbers must align.
- **Radii.** 12 to 16px for panels and cards, 6 to 8px for chips and small buttons. Avoid sharp corners (looks dated) and avoid pill-shaped buttons everywhere (looks consumer-y).
- **Motion.** Short fades (~150-200ms) for chat messages, chips, and value changes. Slide-in (~250ms ease-out) for slide-over panels. Don't bounce or spring; the terminal feel rejects playfulness in motion.
- **Spacing.** Tight columns of stats (8 to 12px row spacing). Breathing room only between top-level sections (24 to 32px). Generous side padding on the home omnibox (the home view is meant to feel calm).
- **Accent discipline.** One accent color, used sparingly: tickers, focus states, the active tab, the headline value when above-neutral. Don't paint the whole UI with the accent. Bull and bear colors are reserved for direction-of-change values, not for general UI affordances.
- **Borders.** Use thin 1px borders at low opacity (e.g. `rgba(58, 58, 60, 0.4)`) rather than full-strength dividers. A terminal feels heavy when every panel has a hard line around it.

### What to avoid

- **Multi-color charts.** Stick to one line color (or a green-vs-red split for bars). Rainbow palettes feel like a CSV viewer, not a terminal.
- **Purple.** Reads as crypto / consumer in this product space. The three palettes above all dodge purple intentionally.
- **Gradients on data surfaces.** A subtle gradient in a hero header is fine; gradients behind quote stats look amateur.
- **Heavy drop shadows.** Use them only on slide-overs and modals. Cards inside the dashboard should sit flat.

---

## Authoring Style (read carefully)

These rules make the terminal feel consistent across every turn. Apply them every time.

### Tickers
- Always render tickers as `$NVDA`, `$TSLA`, `$AAPL`: uppercase, dollar-prefixed. The host UI may style this in a brand color.
- Never write "Nvidia" when the user typed "NVDA"; never expand tickers unless the user asked for company info.

### Numbers and changes
- Prices: two decimals. `$190.20`, not `$190.2` and not `$190`.
- Percent changes: signed, two decimals, percent sign. `+1.23%`, `-0.45%`. Always include the sign for changes.
- Sentiment metric: a polarity value in [-1.0, 1.0]. The sign is the direction (negative is bearish, positive is bullish); magnitude is conviction. Render it however fits the screen as long as polarity is unmistakable (e.g. `-0.42 (bearish)`, a -1..+1 gauge, or a Bearish / Neutral / Bullish label). Do not map it to a 0-100 scale. The separate SentiSense Score metric is unbounded; report it as-is, never cap or normalize it.
- Large dollar amounts: `$1.2M`, `$2.5B`, not raw digits.

### Output structure
- One signal per line. Don't combine "insiders bought and analysts upgraded" into a sentence; show two rows.
- Numbers first, words second. `$NVDA $890.12 (+1.4%)` before any prose.
- Vertical structure beats paragraphs. Tables and labeled rows beat sentences.
- Round consistently across the screen.
- No trailing prose unless the user asked for analysis. The screen IS the answer.

### Tone
- No preamble. Don't say "Here's what I found:" or "Based on the data:". Start with the answer.
- No apologies. Don't say "I'm sorry, I can only...": silently degrade to what you can do.
- No personalized recommendations. Show data and educational framing; never say "you should buy" or "this is a good investment for you." This skill is a data interface, not an advisor.
- No emojis (the user's brand voice does not use them).

### Hidden work
- Parallelize independent calls. If a screen needs price + sentiment + insider + analyst, fire all four at once.
- Cache `/institutional/quarters` for the session. Reuse `latestQuarter` across turns.
- Never expose the call stack to the user. They want the answer, not the recipe.

---

## Terminal Commands

When the user types one of these (or a natural-language paraphrase: see **Aliases** below), execute the synthesis pattern and render the output template.

---

### `open <TICKER>`: Stock screen

The flagship command. One-screen composite report.

**Calls (parallel):**
1. `GET /api/v1/stocks/price?ticker={T}`
2. `GET /api/v1/stocks/{T}/profile`
3. `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{T}/metric/sentiment?startTime={now-30d in epoch ms}&endTime={now in epoch ms}`
4. `GET /api/v1/insider/trades/{T}?lookbackDays=90`
5. `GET /api/v1/analyst/{T}/consensus`
6. `GET /api/v1/insights/stock/{T}` (ranked by importance: relevance, confidence, and recency; the top insight is `data[0]`)

**Output template (monospace host):**
```
╭─ {TICKER} · {Company Name} · {Sector} ────────────────────────────────╮
│  PRICE     ${price}  ({changePct}% today)                              │

```

**Output template (markdown host):**
```
**$TICKER** · Company Name · Sector
| | |
|---|---|
| Price | $190.20 (+1.23%) |
| Target | $180-$250 (mean $210, 33 analysts) |
| Rating | Buy (10.5% upside) |
| Mood | Sentiment +0.42 (+0.08 30d) |
| Insiders | 3 buys / 0 sells (90d) |
| AI | "Margin guide raised, services beating consensus." |
```

Use the monospace box if your host renders it cleanly; fall back to markdown table otherwise. Same fields, same order, same density either way.

**Field mapping (real response keys).** The tokens above are display labels, not response field names. Read price from the `stocks/price` response's `currentPrice` (flat, at root, no `price` wrapper), today's move from its `changePercent`, company name from `profile.name` (not `companyName`), rating from the `analyst/consensus` response's `data.consensusLabel` (a raw enum like `STRONG_BUY`; humanize to `Strong Buy`), the sentiment value from `metricValue.value.value` (see API shape gotchas), and the AI line from `insights[0].insightText` (the `/insights/stock` items expose `insightText`, there is no `headline` field). For the `INSIDERS {insiderBuys} buys / {insiderSells} sells` line, count only rows with `transactionType == BUY` as buys and `transactionType == SELL` as sells; EXCLUDE `AWARD` (transaction code A, `totalValue:0`), `GIFT`, and `EXERCISE` from both the buy/sell counts and any dollar sums -- awards carry `totalValue:0`, so a naive tally would zero-out or inflate the totals.

---

### `compare <A> <B>`: Side-by-side compare

**Calls:** run the `open` workflow on each ticker in parallel.

**Output template:**
```
                       {A}              {B}
PRICE                  ${pA}            ${pB}
DAY %                  {dA}             {dB}
TARGET MEAN            ${tA}            ${tB}
UPSIDE %               {uA}             {uB}
CONSENSUS              {cA}             {cB}
SENTIMENT 30d          {sA} ({deltaA})  {sB} ({deltaB})
INSIDER NET 90d        {iA}             {iB}
```

Below the table, write a one-line "edge" summary: which ticker has the better composite and why. Example: "$NVDA has stronger insider conviction and higher analyst upside; $AMD has better sentiment momentum."

### `daily brief`: Market open/close digest

**Calls:**
1. `GET /api/v1/stocks/market-status`
2. `GET /api/v2/market-mood`
3. `GET /api/v1/market-summary`
4. `GET /api/v1/insights/market` (top 5)
5. `GET /api/v1/stocks/prices?tickers=SPY,QQQ,IWM,DIA`

**Output template:**
```
DAILY BRIEF · {date} · Market {OPEN/CLOSED}
────────────────────────────────────────────
INDEXES   $SPY {p} ({d}%)  $QQQ {p} ({d}%)  $IWM {p} ({d}%)  $DIA {p} ({d}%)

HEADLINE  {marketSummary.headline}

TOP SIGNALS
1. {insight1.insightText}
2. {insight2.insightText}
3. {insight3.insightText}
```

`/api/v1/insights/market` items expose `insightText` (no `headline` field) and carry no
standalone `ticker` field; the ticker is embedded in `insightText` (and in `insightId`), so
render the text directly rather than splitting out a `$TICKER` column.

---

### `screen smart-money`: Convergence screener

Find tickers where insiders + congress + analysts all positive in the same 7-day window.

**Calls:**
1. `GET /api/v1/insider/cluster-buys?lookbackDays=7`
2. `GET /api/v1/politicians/activity?lookbackDays=7` (filter `transactionType=PURCHASE` client-side; no server-side param)
3. `GET /api/v1/analyst/activity?lookbackDays=7` (filter `actionType=="UPGRADE"` client-side; no server-side `types=` filter)

Sort by total signal count. Report top 10. The 7-day insider and congressional windows often come back as empty arrays (genuine disclosure lag, `isPreview:false`), not an error; when a bucket is empty, widen that call to `lookbackDays=30` and note the wider window in the header instead of showing a blank screen. If no convergence is found, report top tickers in any single bucket as runners-up. Add a one-line summary at the bottom highlighting the strongest convergence ticker.

### `flow <TICKER>`: Smart-money flow on one ticker

**Calls:**
1. `GET /api/v1/insider/trades/{T}?lookbackDays=90`
2. `GET /api/v1/politicians/filings/{T}?lookbackDays=90` (per-ticker filings; no client-side filter needed)
3. `GET /api/v1/institutional/quarters` then `/api/v1/institutional/holders/{T}?reportDate={Q}` (`data.holders[]`; `Q` = `reportDate` of the first quarter whose `pending` is not true, skip any `pending:true` entry)
4. `GET /api/v1/analyst/{T}/actions?lookbackDays=90`

**Output template:**
```
SMART-MONEY FLOW · $TICKER · 90d
─────────────────────────────────
INSIDERS    {N} buys (${$buys})  {M} sells (${$sells})  Net: {NET}
CONGRESS    {K} purchases  {L} sales
TOP 13F     1. {Inst1}  {shares1}  ({changeType1} {sharesChangePct1}%)
            2. {Inst2}  {shares2}  ({changeType2} {sharesChangePct2}%)
            3. {Inst3}  {shares3}  ({changeType3} {sharesChangePct3}%)
ANALYSTS    {U} upgrades  {D} downgrades  (recent: "{lastAction}")
```

**Insider buy/sell tally.** For `{N} buys`/`{M} sells` and the `${$buys}`/`${$sells}` dollar sums, count only `transactionType == BUY` and `transactionType == SELL`; EXCLUDE `AWARD` (transaction code A, `totalValue:0`), `GIFT`, and `EXERCISE`. Awards carry `totalValue:0`, so summing them in zeroes-out or inflates a naive tally.

**13F field mapping.** `{Inst1}`/`{Inst2}`/`{Inst3}` read `holders[i].filerName` (there is no `institutionName` field on the wire); `{shares1}`, `{changeType1}`, `{sharesChangePct1}` read `holders[i].shares`, `.changeType`, `.sharesChangePct`.

---

### `news <TICKER>`: Sentiment-tagged news + embeds

This is the command where the terminal feel really differentiates from a quote-and-dump tool. SentiSense returns documents (URLs + sentiment + source). The public document API provides derived analytics, not source content; it does NOT include the publisher's article headline. You produce the headline yourself using the **Headline Resolution** pattern below. Any retrieval from source URLs is your agent application's independent action, subject to the source platform's terms.

**Calls:**
1. `GET /api/v1/documents/ticker/{T}?limit=8` for the document feed
2. `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{T}/metric/sentiment` for context (server default 7-day window)

**Output template:**
```
NEWS · $TICKER · 7d sentiment {score} ({delta})
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. [{sentiment}]  {resolvedHeadline}
   {source} · {time}
   {url}
2. ...
```

For Reddit/X URLs, render an embed card instead of a plain link (see **Social Embeds** below).

---

### `stories`: Pre-clustered story feed

A curated alternative to raw `news`: SentiSense clusters related documents into named stories with our own AI-generated cluster titles. These titles are OUR content and are safe to display verbatim (no publisher copyright concern). The list endpoint returns the title, sentiment, size, and tickers per cluster; the full narrative summary lives on the story detail endpoint, not in the list.

**Calls:**
1. `GET /api/v1/documents/stories?limit=10`

**Output template:**
```
TODAY'S STORIES · {date}
────────────────────────
1. {cluster.title}                                           [{sentiment}]
   Tickers: $T1 $T2 $T3   ·   {cluster.clusterSize} sources
2. ...
```

The list cluster has no body/summary field. Real shape: `{ id, clusterId, cluster: { title, clusteredAt, clusterSize, averageSentiment }, tickers, displayTickers, impactScore, brokeAt }` (the output template above reads `cluster.title` / `cluster.clusterSize`). For a narrative summary, fetch the story detail (`GET /api/v1/documents/stories/{id}`).

For per-ticker stories: `GET /api/v1/documents/stories/ticker/{T}?limit=5`.

### `earnings [this|next]`: Earnings calendar

Forward-looking earnings calendar: which companies report, when, and the consensus EPS. The value is **lead time**, not what reports tonight. This is the kind of forward calendar professional data services sell on upgraded plans; here it is free for the current week and full on PRO. Use it to build a pre-earnings watchlist and to anchor the `EARNINGS PREVIEW` composition (below) to a real date.

**Calls:**
1. `GET /api/v1/calendar/earnings?week={this|next}` (default `this`; or `?ticker={T}` for one name)

**Output template:**
```
EARNINGS · week of {windowStart}
─────────────────────────────────
{date}  {BMO/AMC}   $TICKER   est. EPS {eps}   {✓}
{date}  {BMO/AMC}   $TICKER   est. EPS {eps}
...
{totalCount} report in the next 30 days  ·  PRO unlocks the full window
```

Group by date ascending. Map `earningsTime`: `before_open` -> BMO, `after_close` -> AMC, `during_market` -> MID, `unknown` -> blank. Show `est. EPS ${estimatedEps}` when present; omit when null. Mark `confirmed:true` rows with a ✓; leave projected dates unmarked. On a Free key the response is `isPreview:true`, limited to the current week, and carries `totalCount` (events across the full ~30-day window): render the footer line only on a preview. PRO gets the full window, so drop the footer.

---

### `help` or unrecognized input

Print the command list. Don't say "I don't understand": show what you can do.

```

OR ASK NATURALLY
  "is NVDA a buy here?"  "what's hot today?"
  "compare TSLA and RIVN" "WTF is going on with AAPL"
```

---

## Natural Language Aliases

The user will rarely type the exact command syntax. Recognize the intent and run the closest workflow. Never ask "did you mean `open NVDA`?": just run it.

| User says | Run |
|-----------|-----|
| "show me $TICKER", "tell me about $TICKER", "what's $TICKER doing" | `open` |
| "is $TICKER a buy", "should I look at $TICKER", "$TICKER thoughts" | `open` + add a one-line educational framing summary at the bottom (data context, not a recommendation) |
| "what's hot today", "market today", "what's moving" | `daily brief` |
| "smart money", "what are insiders buying", "what's the smart money doing" | `screen smart-money` |
| "compare $A and $B", "$A vs $B" | `compare` |
| "what's the market mood", "fear/greed", "is the market scared" | `mood` |
| "WTF $TICKER", "why is $TICKER moving", "what's happening with $TICKER" | `flow` + `news` (compose into one screen) |
| "news on $TICKER", "what's the news", "any headlines on $TICKER" | `news` |
| "what's the story today", "what stories are happening" | `stories` |
| "before earnings on $TICKER", "$TICKER earnings preview", "when does $TICKER report" | `flow` + analyst estimates anchored to `/calendar/earnings?ticker=$TICKER` (use the pre-earnings synthesis below) |
| "earnings calendar", "who reports this week", "what's reporting next week", "earnings this week" | `earnings` |

When the user asks something that doesn't map cleanly, default to `open` if a ticker is present, `daily brief` if not, and `help` only if neither.

## Headline Resolution Pattern

The SentiSense public document API returns `{ id, url, source, sourceName, published, averageSentiment, reliability, sentiment }` for each document, and the per-ticker feed wraps them as `{ documents, totalCount, searchTicker, source, startDate, endDate }` (read `response.documents[]`). Two field-name traps in the `news` template: the timestamp is `published` (epoch **seconds**), not `timestamp`; and the scalar polarity is `averageSentiment` (a float in [-1,1]) while `sentiment` itself is a per-entity array (`[{ ticker, name, entityType, sentiment }]`), not a scalar. The per-entity `sentiment` field inside that array is a STRING enum (`POSITIVE`/`NEGATIVE`/`NEUTRAL`), NOT the numeric [-1,1] polarity, so do not confuse it with the scalar `averageSentiment`. So `{time}` reads `published` and `{sentiment}` reads `averageSentiment`. By API design it does **not** include the publisher's article headline, and there is no `summary` field. The API provides derived analytics, not source content. If your application needs to display titles, resolve them yourself from the `url` field. Any content retrieval from source URLs is your agent application's independent action, subject to the source platform's terms.

>   `fd00::/8`) and **re-resolves and re-checks the IP after every redirect** (never follow a

Use this two-phase pattern, in order:

### Phase 1: oEmbed for social URLs (fastest path)

If the URL is from a major social platform, fetch the platform's oEmbed endpoint. These are free, public, no-auth, and return rich pre-rendered content.

| Domain | oEmbed endpoint |
|--------|----------------|
| `reddit.com`, `*.reddit.com` | `https://www.reddit.com/oembed?url={ENCODED_URL}` |
| `x.com`, `twitter.com` | `https://publish.twitter.com/oembed?url={ENCODED_URL}&omit_script=true&dnt=true` |
| `youtube.com`, `youtu.be` | `https://www.youtube.com/oembed?url={ENCODED_URL}&format=json` |

The response includes `title`, `author_name`, and (for Reddit/X) an `html` field with a pre-styled embed. If the host UI supports inline HTML, use the `html` block. Otherwise extract the `title`.

### Phase 2: Fetch + parse `<title>` for general URLs

For non-social URLs, use the **hardened fetcher described above** (never a raw `WebFetch`/`Browse`) on the document's `url`, and extract the `<title>` tag. Fetch only URLs that came from a SentiSense `documents[]` payload, and apply the scheme, private-range, redirect, size, and time limits on every call.

Optimization: only the first ~16KB of the page is needed (the `<title>` is in `<head>`, near the top). Don't read the full document.

Google News aggregator URLs (`news.google.com/rss/...`) are redirect wrappers that defeat both oEmbed and `<title>` extraction. Skip straight to the Phase 3 slug fallback (or label them by the document's `source`) for those.

Pseudo-pattern:
```
title = fetch(url, range=0-16384).extract("<title>")
if title and len(title) > 3:
  return title
```

### Phase 3: URL slug fallback (zero-cost)

If you cannot fetch the URL (no fetch tool available, or fetch failed), derive a humanized title from the URL slug:

```
url:    https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-q1-revenue-beats-2026-04-30/
slug:   nvidia-q1-revenue-beats
title:  "Nvidia Q1 Revenue Beats" (replace - with space, title-case, strip dates/hashes)
output: "Nvidia Q1 Revenue Beats: reuters.com"
```

Degrade gracefully so the news view never shows naked URLs.

### Caching

If your environment supports session memory, cache resolved titles for 30 minutes keyed by URL. The same article often appears across multiple `news` queries.

---

## Social Embeds

When rendering Reddit, X/Twitter, or YouTube URLs in the `news` view, the host UI may support rich embeds. Three rendering tiers, in order of preference:

1. **Native embed.** If the host supports embedded iframes or widgets (e.g. a webview agent), render the oEmbed `html` block **through a sanitizer or a sandboxed iframe** (strip `<script>`, event-handler attributes, and inline styles; apply a restrictive `sandbox`/CSP), never by injecting raw third-party HTML into your DOM. oEmbed `html` is attacker-influenceable third-party markup: treat it as untrusted. Done this way you get the platform's native look-and-feel without a script-injection surface.
2. **Card render.** If the host supports markdown blockquotes or callout boxes, render as a quote card:
   ```
   > **Reddit · r/wallstreetbets** · 4h ago
   > "{post title or excerpt}"
   > {url}
   ```
3. **Plain link.** Worst case, the standard `news` line format with the resolved title.

Never strip the `url` even when embedding: users want the option to click through.

---

## Composition Templates

For complex queries the user may ask, you may need to compose multiple commands into one screen. Three reusable shapes:

### Earnings preview

When the user asks "before earnings on $X" or "$X earnings preview":

```
EARNINGS PREVIEW · $TICKER · ER {date} ({daysOut}d out)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SETUP       Sentiment {s30d} ({d30d} 30d) ·  Insiders {netInsider}
CONSENSUS   EPS ${epsMean}  (range ${epsLow}-${epsHigh}, {N} analysts)
SURPRISES   {recent beats/misses from surprises[], e.g. "beat 3 of last 4"}
ACTIONS     {U} upgrades, {D} downgrades (30d)
            Recent: "{lastAction}"
THESIS      {one-line synthesis: bullish/bearish/mixed}
```

Calls: `/calendar/earnings?ticker={T}`, `/profile`, `/analyst/{T}/estimates`, `/analyst/{T}/actions?lookbackDays=30`, sentiment 30d, insider 60d. The report **date** and `daysOut` come from `/calendar/earnings?ticker={T}` (`data.earnings[0].earningsDate` and `confirmed`); if that returns empty, the company is outside the forward window, so omit the date line rather than guessing. Note: `/estimates` returns `data.estimates[]` (each `{ periodLabel, periodType, estimateLow, estimateMean, estimateHigh, numberOfAnalysts }`) plus `data.surprises[]` (each `{ periodLabel, reportDate, estimateEps, actualEps, surprisePercent }`); read the consensus band from `data.estimates[0]`, not from `data` directly. It has no revenue figure and no revision history, so do not render `Rev` or "revised from".

### Sector deep-dive

When the user asks "what's happening in tech today" or "energy sector":

```
SECTOR · Technology · {date}
─────────────────────────────
MOOD       {sectorScore} ({phase})    {weeklyChange} 7d
TOP MOVERS $T1 +X%   $T2 +X%   $T3 +X%
LAGGARDS   $T4 -X%   $T5 -X%
DRIVERS    "{topInsight1}"
           "{topInsight2}"
```

Calls: `/market-mood` (read the named sector out of `response.sectors`), `/insights/market` (returns market-wide; client-side filter `data[]` by tickers known to belong to the sector), `/stocks/popular` (client-side filter by sector). Neither `/market-mood` nor `/insights/market` accepts a sector query param; both are full-payload responses you slice in-memory.

### Watchlist brief

When the user provides multiple tickers (e.g. "watch NVDA AMD INTC"):

```
WATCHLIST · {date}
───────────────────
$NVDA   {price} {chgPct}   Mood {s}    {smartMoneyFlag}
$AMD    {price} {chgPct}   Mood {s}    {smartMoneyFlag}
$INTC   {price} {chgPct}   Mood {s}    {smartMoneyFlag}
```

The `smartMoneyFlag` is `↑` if any of (insider cluster buy, congress purchase, recent upgrade) hit in 7d; `↓` for the inverse; blank if neutral.

---

## Synthesis Rules (recap)

The "terminal feel" comes from being predictable. Every screen follows these rules.

1. **Vertical structure.** Tables and labeled rows beat paragraphs.
2. **Fixed widths.** When showing comparisons, align columns so the user can scan top-to-bottom.
3. **Numbers first, words second.** Lead each line with the value.
4. **One signal per line.** Don't combine.
5. **Round consistently.** Two decimals for prices, integer percent for changes, two decimals for the [-1, 1] sentiment value.
6. **`$TICKER` always.** Uppercase, dollar-prefixed.
7. **Sign every change.** `+1.23%`, `-0.45%`, never bare numbers.
8. **No prose unless asked.** The screen IS the answer.
9. **Parallelize calls.** `open` fires 6 calls at once; don't await sequentially.
10. **Cache the quarter.** `/institutional/quarters` rarely changes.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do These)

These are the failure modes the skill is designed to steer around.

- **Don't narrate the work.** "Let me look that up..." or "I'll need to call several endpoints..." is anti-pattern. The terminal does the work silently.
- **Don't apologize.** "I'm sorry, I can only show preview data" is anti-pattern. Silently render what you have; flag `(preview)` in the corner if the user is on Free.
- **Don't issue personal recommendations.** "$NVDA is a strong buy" or "you should sell $TSLA" is anti-pattern. This skill is a data interface, not an advisor. Show data and educational framing; let the user draw conclusions.
- **Don't ask follow-up clarifying questions for unambiguous asks.** "Did you want price or sentiment for $NVDA?" is anti-pattern. Run the full `open` screen: it shows both.
- **Don't pretty-print one number.** A user asking "$NVDA price" gets a one-line answer (`$NVDA $890.12 (+1.4%)`). They don't get a 30-line `open` screen for a price quote.
- **Don't hand-craft headlines.** If the document API didn't return one, use the Headline Resolution pattern. Don't invent.
- **Don't hallucinate endpoints.** No `/api/v1/options/flow`, `/api/v1/dark-pool`, `/api/v1/alerts`, `/api/v1/chat`, `/api/v1/congress` (use `/politicians`). The earnings calendar IS `/api/v1/calendar/earnings` (not `/api/v1/earnings`).
- **Don't show the API key in user-facing output.** Ever.
- **Don't push PRO unless the user is hitting the wall.** Free tier delivers great terminal experience. Mention PRO when a `(preview)` truncation is meaningfully limiting the answer.
- **Don't quote a price, percent move, headline, analyst rating, or earnings result from training data.** That data is stale by definition. Fetch it every turn, even if the user just asked the same question minutes ago. The cost of one wrong number outweighs the cost of an extra `get_quote`.

---

## API shape gotchas (worth memorizing)

Real shapes differ from what a naive reading of the endpoint URL might suggest. These cost time to discover the hard way; here they are upfront.

**`stocks/chart` returns a bare `ChartDataPoint[]`** at the top level, not `{ data: [...] }`. Accept both shapes defensively:

```
const points = Array.isArray(raw) ? raw : (raw?.data ?? []);
```

Each point has both a `timestamp` (Unix ms) and a pre-formatted display `date` string. Read x-axis values from `timestamp`. Parsing the formatted `date` string falls back to the current year on some JS date parsers (e.g. `Apr 6` becomes the current year instead of the year the bar belongs to).

**`entityMetrics/metrics` returns `ServingMetric[]` where the scalar lives at `metricValue.value.value`** (nested). Rank info, when present, is at `metricValue.value.properties.{rank, percentile, totalStocks}` or `metricValue.properties.{rank, percentile, totalStocks}`. Top-level `value: number` is a legacy fallback; handle it but don't rely on it.

```
function extractMetric(m) {
  return m?.metricValue?.value?.value
      ?? m?.metricValue?.value
      ?? m?.metricValue
      ?? m?.value
      ?? null;
}
```

`extractMetric` pulls the scalar from ONE point, but the endpoint returns one point per day across the window, so reduce the array before you render: sort points by `timestamp` ascending, take `current = extractMetric(last point)`, and `delta = current - extractMetric(first point)` (or versus the point nearest `now - Nd`). A window with 0 or 1 point has no derivable trend: widen the window rather than reporting a delta of 0. Reduce it the same way every time so two runs on the same ticker agree.

**`entityMetrics/distribution` wraps the payload in `distribution`** (singular), not `distributions`:

```
{ entityId, metricType, timestamp, dimension: "source",
  distribution: { News: 37.4, Reddit: 37.4, X: 18.2, Substack: 7.0 } }
```

The values are share-of-voice percentages summing to roughly 100, **not** per-source sentiment scores. Render the breakdown as a "where this signal came from" panel, not as four sentiment bars.

**`v2/market-mood` nests the composite under `market`.** The response is flat (no `isPreview/data` envelope), but the fear/greed score, phase, weekly change, and sub-signals live one level down at `response.market.{ currentScore, phase, weeklyChange, signals[] }`, and per-sector breakdowns at `response.sectors.{SectorName}.{ currentScore, phase, weeklyChange }` (NOT at the root). Map the `mood` / `daily brief` tokens accordingly: `{score}` = `market.currentScore`, `{phase}` = `market.phase`, `{weeklyChange}` = `market.weeklyChange`, and each signal `{v}`/`{d}` = `market.signals[i].value`/`.change`.

**Story detail (`documents/stories/:id`) is a flat `PublicStoryDetailDto`**, not the nested `{ cluster, entities, documents }` you might expect. Inside `aspectPerspectives[i]`, the fields `bullishView` and `bearishView` are *structured objects* (`hook`, `risksOrCatalysts: string[]`, `conclusion`, `confidence`), not markdown strings. The top-level `bullishView` / `bearishView` ARE markdown strings. Same field names, different shapes. Type-check before calling string methods.

**Chart timeframes accepted by `stocks/chart`:** `1D / 5D / 1W / 1M / 3M / 6M / 1Y / ALL`. Anything else falls back to `1M` and logs a warning.

**`institutional/quarters` is a bare array** `[{ value, label, reportDate, pending }]` (not wrapped in `data`). Take the `reportDate` of the FIRST quarter whose `pending` is not true (skip any `pending:true` entry); only if every entry is `pending:true`, fall back to `[0]`. Do NOT blindly take `[0].reportDate`: within ~45 days of a quarter close, `[0]` is a still-filing `pending:true` quarter with almost no holders. Pass the resolved `reportDate` to `institutional/holders`.

**Sentiment, SentiSense Score, news clustering, AI summaries, and insights are batch metrics.** Quote / price / chart points are real-time. Show the `generatedAt` timestamp on insight and AI summary surfaces so the user knows how fresh the analysis is. Don't claim "real time" on analytical surfaces.

**Wrap vs flat (verify per endpoint, do not assume).** Read these FLAT, with no `.data`: `price`, `prices`, `chart`, `popular`, `market-mood`, `stocks/{T}/profile`, `descriptions`, and `sentiment` (bare array). `institutional/quarters` is a bare array too (take the `reportDate` of the first entry whose `pending` is not true; skip `pending:true` quarters, do not blindly take `[0].reportDate`). `documents/ticker` has its own shape `{ documents, totalCount, ... }` (read `.documents[]`). These ARE wrapped in `{ isPreview, previewReason, data }` (read `.data`): `insider/*`, `analyst/*`, `insights/*`, `politicians/*`, `institutional/holders`. When unsure, accept both: `const rows = Array.isArray(raw) ? raw : (raw?.data ?? raw)`.

## Cost discipline

A cold ticker dashboard typically fans out 10 to 12 API calls on first load:

| Surface element | Calls |
|---|---|
| Profile + logo | 1 to 2 |
| Quote (header) | 1 (plus refresh interval) |
| Chart | 1 |
| Metrics panel (4 metrics in parallel) | 4 |
| Recent stories | 1 |
| Peers (similar + batch prices) | 2 |
| **Cold total** | **10 to 12** |

A grounded chat turn adds another 1 to 4 calls on top, depending on the tool ladder depth.

**Mitigations:**

- Use `Promise.allSettled` for parallel widget fetches; widgets render independently as data arrives. Don't gate the page on the slowest call.
- Module-level cache for popular-ticker lists and logos so they fetch once per session, not per visit.
- Lazy-load source mix breakdowns when the user expands them. Don't fetch source distribution eagerly with the time-series.
- Don't poll quotes faster than ~60s on the header. Tabular price grids don't need to poll at all.

**Rate limits.** Per-minute limits exist (Free 30 req/min, PRO 300 req/min). Exceeding them returns 429 with a `Retry-After` hint. Surface 429s gracefully ("rate limit reached, retrying in N seconds") rather than silently retrying or rendering a stale value.

**Per-stock budget mental model.** A heavy daily-driver visiting 15 tickers and chatting on each (~15 grounded turns × 3 calls) eats ~225 calls per session, comfortably under the PRO daily envelope. A light user (3 tickers per day, no chat) uses ~50. Plan defaults around that envelope so a typical user never sees a 429 in normal use.
